What is the most bizarre thing you've caught yourself doing after your brain's autopilot misfired?
<html><body>
<br>My maths homework.
<br>About three years ago I had a page of algebra to solve. I put it all on the table, but then got into a conversation with my dad (can't remember what it was about, probably politics). I tend to fiddle when I'm talking to someone, but this particular time I was absentmindedly writing the answers down. When we were done talking I said ‘now I've got to do… wait, when did I answer these?’

If you were an ancient god, what would the ritual be to summon you?
<html><body>
<br>My answer:
<br>Well hang on, I need to be tactical here. I don’t want to be summoned every five minutes, I need a ritual that takes some dedication, intelligence, good will, and resolve; as well as something that will exemplify my power. Also I need something adequately bizarre and unnecessary.
<br>I will appear to drink your mead, eat your steak, and listen to your mortal troubles.

You have an unlimited amount of Rice Krispies Treats. What would you do and how would you do it?
<html><body>
<br>Answer with something creative, not just selling and getting rich. Means by which the Rice Krispies Treats come to you: You can summon them
<br>Okay, no, I think there's something people are failing to understand here.
<br>We aren't talking about a lot of Rice Krispies Treats here.
<br>We aren't talking about millions of Rice Krispies Treats here.
<br>We are talking about literally unlimited numbers. Infinite. As many as I want. I'm going to take over the world, the fuck you saying?
<br>It's simple. I walk in front of say, Buckingham palace, and announce through a megaphone that I can summon as many Rice Krispies Treats as I desire. Of course no one believes me, so I summon one, and then another, and then enough to completely fill the street.
<br>Naturally I get arrested and sent to some MI5 facility to be held and studied. However at every turn I summon more and more Rice Krispies Treats.
<br>People start to shoot me? Highly compressed Rice Krispies Treats become a bullet proof wall.
<br>By this point the news that someone summoned seven million Rice Krispies Treats in front of the Queens house is all over the Internet.
<br>I demand to be released, and once I am I make some very simple demands.
<br>One: all nuclear weapons are to be completely destroyed, alongside all other large scale weapons used in this continued and half assed Cold War we are in.
<br>Two: basic freedoms such as free religion, free speech, and marriage equality are to be granted and recongnised world wide.
<br>Three: Disney animation studios are to drop any other projects currently being worked on, and produce a top quality sequel to Zootopia.
<br>If any of these demands are not met, I will crush those refusing under a giant pile of Rice Krispies Treats. If anyone attempts to kill me, they will be taken out by an elite group of mercenaries I am paying in diamonds made from incredibly compressed Rice Krispies Treats. If the Zootopia sequel sucks, I will destroy the solar system using a black hole created by a Dave Consiglio scale of Rice Krispies Treats.

If someone were to inhabit your body for one day, what advice would you give them?
<html><body>
<br>As in, they become you for twenty-four hours, as you are right now, all strings attached.
<br>Enjoy.
<br>While in this body, you have a great many fortunes. For instance you can eat whatever you like, no allergies to worry about. You can push it pretty hard as well, most physical activities should be pretty easy.
<br>You might struggle to get to sleep, so I'd suggest just leaving it; you'll easily be able to stay awake for 24 hours.
<br>If you don't mind needles, would you mind getting me up to date with my boosters? I can't stand them. In return you can visit an art gallery with perfect eyesight, or like, eat tons of junk food.
<br>Please don't like, jerk off or anything, that'd be a bit weird. And remember for optimal running conditions just add coffee.

What made you change your views on free speech?
<html><body>
<br>I started offending people.
<br>I used to think that some speech should be banned. After all, racism is bad right? It’s offensive, you shouldn’t be allowed to be racist, right?
<br>After several months of using Quora, I realised a lot of people were offended by what I had to say. My views on politics, abortion, and society offended them just the same way as other things offend me. But of course, I wouldn’t want the government preventing me expressing what I have to say.
<br>If other people’s offence isn’t a valid reason for me to be silenced, then my offence isn’t a valid reason for them to be silenced.

What entertaining things would you let me do at your house for $100?
<html><body>
<br>Be creative, for example you could teach me woodworking. Charge me $20 per hour to use your Arcade collection, maybe $5 to play on your swings, perhaps $10 to see your personal collection of trains. Seriously anything, but it has to be real.
<br>Curious what hidden treasures are out there.
<br>Ooh, fun question.
<br>Archery lessons, £15 an hour all equipment provided. Learn from someone with about a year’s experience, 1–1.
<br>Video game demos. Play from a collection of over 400 games spanning across 8 consoles and a PC. New and retro games alike. Only £10 an hour.
<br>Maybe you’d like to see a collection of Zulu-war era weaponry, including rifles, clubs, spears, and bayonets. Full tour for £20.
<br>Or perhaps you’d like to hear me sing. £50 and I’ll shut up.

What would you say to death if you met it?
<html><body>
<br>Death: It's nice to meet you again.
<br>Me: Again? I don't remember any previous encounter.
<br>Death: You've known me for a long time. You've spoken my name, you've cursed me, you've fought me, and you've watched as I did my job.
<br>Me: You have taken a lot away from me. You have threatened me a lot.
<br>Death: Exactly. You know me, right down to your core. There have been times when you've hated me, but mostly you fear me.
<br>Me: I've never feared you. I have simply sought to understand you.
<br>Death: If you never feared me, why did you spend so much time avoiding me?
<br>Me: I appreciated what I had in life. I knew you to be a curtain, one I couldn't peer beyond and one I couldn't return from. I knew I would have to cross the curtain some day, but I wanted to enjoy what I had before I did.
<br>Death: And you're telling me that no matter how close to that curtain you got, you didn't fear it?
<br>Me: Very well. You're not wrong. I have feared you. I cannot reason why I have felt fear towards that which I knew would happen either way, I guess I mostly feared that which I didn't understand.
<br>Death: And now that I am stood before you, do you still fear me?
<br>Me: My apprehension has never been stronger. I feel like I should understand you better now, but upon seeing you face to face you make less sense than ever.
<br>Death: And why is that?
<br>Me: Because I recognise you. I've seen you before, as if in a dream. Not your work, not the concept of you, but you yourself. How? I have never died before.
<br>Death: I was with you for an eternity. One that is impossible to remember. You never thought of it as death, you simply knew it as it was. It didn't feel like anything special, and it seemed no time at all.
<br>Me: It was the time before I was born, wasn't it?
<br>Death: If that's the way you choose to consider it. Life exists, it's a thing to experience and explore. But it's temporary, and delicate. I must always come back for you.
<br>Me: So what now? Now that you've finally claimed me, where do we go?
<br>Death: Now you may walk with me. Some things are a curtain even for me. I cannot tell you where you may end up.
<br>Me: I may? Do I have another option?
<br>Death: You can try to fight me. Like you have before. You may win more time. But I will still have to return for you, eventually.
<br>Me: One day I will let you lead the way. One day I will come with you. But I'm sorry, right now I'm not finished.
<br>Death: Very well. Let's see if you can win this time. But you have one disadvantage, one you will never shake so long as you choose to be naive.
<br>Me: What is that?
<br>Death: Jake, no matter what, you still fear me.

What would your computer say to you if it could talk?
<html><body>
<br>Computer: Dude, what the fuck?
<br>Me: What?
<br>Com: What the hell are you looking at?
<br>Me: It's called fur-
<br>Com: Can we please look at something else?! Anything?
<br>Me: Fine, fine.
<br>*Few minutes later*
<br>Com: Mate, I can see the amount in your account, and I can see the amount in your Amazon basket. Are you sure about buying all that?
<br>Me: Oh come on, this stuff is important.
<br>Com: A replica halberd is important?
<br>Me: Well I mean it's… fine, I'll get rid of the weaponry, but I'm still buying the top hat!
<br>Com: *heavy sigh*
<br>*Few minutes later*
<br>Com: What is this website?
<br>Me: It's called Quora, it's filled with intellectuals and curious people, we gather to share knowledge and ideas.
<br>Com: Does anyone actually talk to you?
<br>Me: Don't get clever, I'll have you know I'm very popular on here
<br>Com: Captain, I detect no signs of intelligent life.
<br>Me: Hey screw you!
<br>*Later that night*
<br>Com: Go… the fuck… to bed.
<br>Me: come on, just one more game.
<br>Com: You've been playing Age of Empires for three hours now, you don't need another game.
<br>Me: You’re right! It has been three hours since I last played Civ5. I'm going to start another campaign!
<br>Com: It's two in the morning, and you have class at eight!
<br>Me: I think I'll play as the Aztecs this time.
<br>Com: *Screaming*

My daughter is taking gender studies at college and now she tells me I am a male oppressor. Should I keep paying her tuition?
<html><body>
<br>I'm surprised at all these answers saying this is a good thing.
<br>Firstly, the conclusion I've drawn is that she has most likely learned these things from said gender studies class or the people that are there.
<br>From there, I'm going to say that this ‘gender studies’ class is most likely a one sided and closed debate class, whereby your daughter is simply parroting what people there say. If she had much maturity or common sense about her she would realise that as you are paying her tuition (something you are under no legal obligation to do), as well as most likely other expenses (ditto), you are not any form of ‘oppressor’. As she is not able to make this leap, then I have to believe that she isn't drawing the conclusion that you are one by herself either.
<br>So what can you do?
<br>I wouldn't stop paying her tuition. That would be unnecessarily damaging to her future.
<br>I would challenge her on why she believes these things, and provide counter evidence (such as the previously mentioned paying of her stuff). It will be difficult, if not impossible for her to justify these sudden beliefs.
<br>I would also encourage (and that isn't a euphemism for force) her to look into other classes and clubs she can join. I'm sure if she, say, volunteers with elderly veterans, or perhaps does some work at a police station, she will realise the brave work women and men are doing to keep her safe. I’d like to see her justify these alt-left values then.
<br>Honestly, this is probably just a delayed and rather poor teenage rebellion.
<br>Before anyone gives me flak for not immediately siding with the regressive-feminist class, I'd suggest you consider how you'd respond if this was a story about a young lad who started calling his mother a ‘female oppressor’.
</body></html>
Would you raise your children like your parents raised you?
<html><body>
<br>No, I wouldn't.
<br>Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with the way my parents raised me. They did and continue to do their absolute best and it's worked out quite well. I just find their general ideas to be lacking, and I think I can see that had I been a different sort of person it could have ended very badly.
<br>To cut it short they were too loose in areas where I could have done with some guidance, and too conservative in areas where I would have appreciated a little freedom. They never taught me very much, even things like cooking or ironing. But at the same time they were overprotective and didn't let me experience things until it was too late.
<br>The idea was right, there needs to be a balance, but they got it the wrong way around.
</body></html>
Is Quora for real? I mean are these actual answers from real people?
<html><body>
<br>In most cases, yes, the answers are from real people. I'm the only exception, all of my answers are created by an AI that is using predictive algorithms and information available on the dark web to pass a Turing test. So far, so good.
<br>In all seriousness, I don't quite get how Quora could be fake. I suppose the questions and answers could be typed up by employees (some actually are), but that would be a lot harder than it just existing. People are free to lie, if that's what you're asking, this is the internet after all. However I would say most answers on Quora are mostly true.

What is the biggest mindblow ever?
<html><body>
<br>Most people are familiar with Pi right? 3.141592653…
<br>Well lets say I was to write it out in full. Impossible, obviously, but for the sake of argument lets say I do it. Then, I convert all even digits (including zeros) to ‘0’, and all odd digits to ‘1’.
<br>Now I have 1101110011… in an infinite, non repeating sequence of binary information.
<br>‘So what?’ I hear you ask. So everything. No, literally everything. Every bit of information ever to exist will be contained somewhere in this string. The story of your life; the story of my life; the history of mankind; the history of the universe; this answer; hell, everything ever written and everything that ever will, won’t, or could be written. All of it would be there.
<br>But here comes the mindfuck: despite having all that knowledge at your hands, despite it all being there, with no possible method of finding it amongst the random code of 1s and 0s, you wouldn’t be able to do anything with it. It would be meaningless. Because as much as we played with it, the only thing you actually have is Pi.
<br>π- Behold, everything and nothing.
<br>Edit: I got three different comments in over 100 forms. So let me give the rundown:
</body></html>
Why are British people so obsessed with American guns?
<html><body>
<br>Obviously this doesn't apply to all British people and MANY of them could care less but the amount of British people who feel the need to tell me why I shouldnt own a gun and why it is evil and only an insane person would own one shocks me.
<br>Because it's such a cultural difference.
<br>In Britain, guns are seen as weapons and nothing else. They serve the purpose of killing things, and most Brits would say that guns belong in the hands of soldiers, farmers, and hunters, not random citizens. If you keep a glock in your house or walk around with a rifle then you are a criminal by default.
<br>In America, guns are seen as an essential part of freedom, safety, and self reliance. They serve the purposes of protecting the population, keeping the government in check, and showing American values. Most Americans would say that at least some form of gun should be free to be owned.
<br>Saying to a Brit “I keep a gun in my house in case I need to defend myself” is like saying “I keep a scuba tank in the bathroom in case I drown in the bath.” There is such a leap that most Brits are somewhere between confused and fascinated.

Should the Oxford comma be eliminated?
<html><body>
<br>The Oxford Comma (also known as the Harvard Comma and the Serial Comma) is the comma between the penultimate item in a series and the series' conjunction. E.g., in the sentence "I like bacon, pork chops, and pork belly," the comma between "pork chops" and "and" is the Oxford comma.
<br>The Oxford comma is the only difference between being attacked by two dogs, a shepherd and a boxer; or being attacked by two dogs, a shepherd, and a boxer.
<br>It definitely serves a purpose, and every time I see it ignored the errorists win.

What strange habit would you like to admit to today?
<html><body>
<br>I assign colours to a lot of non physical things.
<br>I found out one of my friends does the same thing. He was putting coloured notes on different subject books (he's doing A-levels), and we got into a discussion over which colours should go where.
<br>Me: biology is definitely green, I'm sorry it just is
<br>Him: what? No, biology is red. Environmental studies is green.
<br>Me: if biology is red then what's psychology?
<br>Him: psychology is purple, obviously
<br>Me: how can psychology be purple when physics is purple?
<br>Him: (pause) okay, psychology is a darker purple than physics. Physics is more of a lilac.
<br>Me: I'm not going to argue with that. But art is yellow right?
<br>Him: no way art is white
<br>We can't be the only ones that do this.

Liberals: What is the liberal position you have the most trouble getting on board with?
<html><body>
<br>Triggered, trigger warnings, safe spaces, et al.
<br>In case you aren't aware, I know people (military and non military alike) who suffer from PTSD. I'm not here to say that people with such an awful condition don't really experience triggers, of course they do. Often these triggers are unusual things you wouldn't expect, such as trumpets, plastic barrels, and even in one case Coca Cola cans.
<br>You know who doesn’t experience this?
<br>I can't believe it sometimes, it sounds like it's made up. A lot of people genuinely believe that it is harmful for them to hear things they don't like, or see violent content on the internet, or even freaking be near someone who holds an opinion they don't hold. They use terms like 'violence’ when what they mean is someone said something they don't like, and then they use medical terms to describe the offence. Fucking triggered my ass.
<br>And I really wouldn't care, I wouldn't, if it wasn't for the fact that I'm expected to censor myself for their benefit. If they want to get all upset and pretend they have a serious mental condition that they don't have then that's up to them, but when people are trying to ban things that these conceited cry babies don't like, that's Orwellian shit right there.
<br>And I know what people are going to say. “But Jake, safe spaces are private property, they’re free to do what they want there.” and you're right, just as they’re free to shove firecrackers up their own asses on private property, that doesn't make it any less fucking stupid.
<br>The second it actually makes it to law that we all need to bend over backwards to accommodate these people, I hope you will all join me in shouting obscenities through megaphones at them.
<br>Ah, the authoritarian left. Not only will it oppress you, it will also make you feel guilty about it.
</body></html>
What do you think about teenagers on Quora?
<html><body>
<br>I'm pretty sure they make up about 50% of my follower base.
<br>I'll be honest here, pretty much everything I write is with teenagers in mind. I'm young myself, so I don't have much to offer anyone else on the ‘life experience’ front. My opinions are obviously free for the taking, but in my experience young people benefit more from hearing different viewpoints, older people have usually heard them already or don't want to hear them at all. Also most of the pop culture I talk about is, for the most part, shared with people of a similar age to me (wow, I don't even know what happened to the grammar here).
<br>I see Quora as kinda like the perfect youth club; they need to be somewhere on the internet, and it's much better they're here than with a bad crowd on Snapchat (tongue firmly in cheek).

Why does the Queen of the United Kingdom not have a British passport?
<html><body>
<br>Does she not need one when she travels outside of the UK and its territories? Is there anyone else in the world who does not require a passport to travel abroad?
<br>To put it simply, all a British passport does is say that the Queen has allowed and requested your free travel. The Queen doesn't need a passport to travel for the same reason the host doesn't need a party invitation.
<br>She can simply say that she allows and requests her own free travel, and she effectively has a passport.

What unpopular opinions do you have about video games?
<html><body>
<br>Most of the problems with the video game industry are due to the players, and not the devs.
<br>You want to know what developers are motivated by these days? Money. They want to sell as many copies at as high a price as possible, then continue to make additional money through micro transactions, DLC, and subscription fees.
<br>You want to know what developers were motivated by in the past? Money. They wanted to sell as many copies at as high a price as possible, then continue to make additional money through micro transactions, DLC, and subscription fees.
<br>What's changed is where the money is, and what players are asking for, and what we are willing to accept.
<br>Take Call of Duty for example. It's a franchise that many (myself included) feel used to be a lot better than it is. It didn't change because the developers got greedy, corporations are always greedy, it changed because people asked it to. Players started to buy more and more DLC, we all did. Whenever DLC came out everyone bought it. We got more excited over DLC than the game itself, and that just generated more publicity. The company just realised it was more cost effective to give half a game and then sell us the rest piece by piece, because that's what we were effectively already doing.
<br>Everything comes back to the players. The reason there's no secrets or suprises anymore is because everyone demands to know everything in advance. The reason story based games are hard to find is because everyone demands a big open world and side missions. The problem lies with a consumer that doesn't know what it wants.

Why are children still being told lies about how to cope with bullying properly?
<html><body>
<br>The only reason why bullying exists is because children are not being taught how to defend themselves. Most of the time, a simple "go to the police" or "practise martial arts" or "take a screwdriver with you next time and the problem is solved" -> see 1st comment for the rest.
<br>Because it sounds better.
<br>People are more likely to send their children to the school that says ‘we have a zero tolerance policy to bullying and fighting, and deal with the problem by removing all such children and/ or punishing them effectively’ than the school that says ‘hey, rather than that bullshit line, we will instead teach kids to stand up for themselves, physically if they must, against bullies’. But believe me, the first school is talking bullshit.
<br>Meanwhile, parents are more likely to let their children watch the TV show with the cuddly looking panda that says ‘if you're being bullied, tell a grown up and it will magically go away’ than the show that says ‘aim for the nose when hitting a bully, if they see blood they're probably going to be weely weely scared and not bully you anymore’.
<br>And all of this is because most parents were never bullied themselves, so they don't know anything about it. They don't understand that the actual solution to the problem usually ends in punches and kicks, and instead prefer the idea that their children can solve all their problems with their grown up words, and not have to ‘resort’ to violence.
<br>And if it sounds like I'm being patronising, it's so maybe people can begin to get a glimmer as to what it's like to hear the words ‘it's not okay to hit someone back, why didn't you tell a teacher?’ after telling said teacher twenty times and watching jack shit happen.

What's one thing that most people do that you can't?
<html><body>
<br>Smile for photos.
<br>Most people can pull off a realistic and natural smile when the camera is on them. I can't do that.
<br>I mean, I don't appear in photos all that often (you guys know all about that), but when I do I look ten times better without smiling than when I try to force out a cheesy grin. Usually I go for more of a calm look than a happy one.

What is that voice in your head while you're reading silently? Why does it happen?
<html><body>
<br>It's known as subvocalisation and it's not fully understood.
<br>Most people will subvocalise while reading, but some never will, instead just picking the meaning up without sounding out individual words. You can train yourself not to hear the little voice, I can basically turn it on and off.

As a feminist, do you believe that women hitting men is acceptable?
<html><body>
<br>People in a relationship, not random people. Do you think there should be any repercussions like men have for domestic abuse? Should men have the right to defend themselves?
<br>Absolutely unacceptable, I think we all agree on that.
<br>Should there be repercussions? Absolutely, assault is a crime and so any perpetrator should be prosecuted fully.
<br>Should men have a right to defend themselves? They do, self defence laws don't specify gender, and I will absolutely support that.

<br>The mathematician calculates exactly how much water he needs to escape, yells ‘there is a solution’, and burns to death.

What is the proper response to having your butt slapped by a stranger in public?
<html><body>
<br>I've had it happen actually.
<br>I don't know if it was the proper response, but my personal response was to grab them by the collar, pull them in very close, and calmly and clearly say ‘if you touch me again, I will break your fucking fingers, understand?’
<br>I don't know if any of you know what my voice sounds like; suffice to say the incident wasn't repeated.

If every human on earth suddenly vanished, what would things be like: Immediately, 1 week, 1 month, 1, 10, 100, 1,000, and 1 million years from now?
<html><body>
<br>Going off my own predictions:
</body></html>
At 16 years old, if someone gave you $1000, what would you have bought?
<html><body>
<br>At 16, I would have totally wasted it. I would have spent it on videogames, Warhammer figures, random crap off Amazon, medieval weaponry, and clothes.
<br>Basically, I would have done the same then as I would now.
</body></html>
Did man really land on the moon?
<html><body>
<br>Let me get this straight.
<br>People say man didn't really land on the moon. They say that somehow, billions of dollars were sunk into a project whereby the worlds largest hoax occurred. Giant rockets that didn't actually go anywhere were launched multiple times in front of people, while hundreds of other people pretended to be mission control, astronauts, film crews, and everyone else shown. Every news industry on the planet was either in on it, or completely fooled. The USSR, who were spending billions spying on America, found no evidence of this hoax, and bought it. And, to top it off, in the 47 years since not a single person, out of the hundreds of people who must be in on it, have come forward despite the massive opportunity for fame and fortune. Oh, and the reflector is actually a naturally occurring phenomenon, not a clear example of human engineering.
<br>I'm sorry, but that would actually be more impressive than landing on the moon.
<br>Yes, we landed on the moon, not because it was easy, but because tricking everyone into thinking we did would be freaking impossible.

What is a non-political opinion you have that is likely very unpopular?
<html><body>
<br>Ooh, let's see
</body></html>
Why do some liberals attack anyone who says "All Lives Matter"?
<html><body>
<br>See also Why do Black Lives Matter? Why is it so controversial to say "all lives matter" instead? Is it insensitive to do this?
<br>You know what I love? The same people who say ‘all lives matter’ are the people who, this time of year, get real pissy when someone says ‘happy holidays’ instead of ‘merry Christmas’. All holidays matter, right? Shouldn't we be talking about Easter and Halloween just as much right now?
<br>‘Liberals’ ‘attack’ ‘anyone’ (notice the air quotes here) who says ‘all lives matter’ because it's dismissive. ALM is a way of saying ‘I don't care about the issues you're trying to raise, because I'm too busy sitting here worrying about my crap. Let them eat cake.’ In a world where saying ‘black lives matter’ is so freaking controversial that people decide to start counter movements, it's pretty clear that some people need reminding that we aren't in a post race era.

<br>It's 11 o'clock at night.
<br>I'm in bed.
<br>My window is open.
<br>So, I suppose after a quick look to determine what has just fallen in my lap, I'll fling it onto the street below.
<br>Pity any poor soul out for a late night walk.

If I searched Jake Williams’ name on Google images, would I find Jake Williams’ face without ever even knowing?
<html><body>
<br>anonymous in case I actually get an answer
<br>No, you wouldn't. Believe me, I've tried.
<br>I don't think people on Quora fully understand the lengths I go to in order to keep my face, and other personal details, off of the Internet. I've been doing this long before I got a Quora account. I hardly ever let people take photos of me, I'm not ‘friends’ with any of my family members on Facebook, I've never once spoken about where exactly I am, I've never posted up any photos or videos with my face in them. It goes way beyond ‘not posting things on Quora’.
<br>Call me paranoid, call me whatever, Internet shit can cause people to get fired or lose opportunities. I always keep a level of deniability, and that involves keeping my face out of the digital world.
<br>And FYI, my name is incredibly common. I know a lot of people think they've found stuff about me, in fact I've had people claim they know me. To put in perspective:
<br>Jake Williams
<br>This guy goes to a school that's about half an hours drive from where I live, and he has a Quora account. I went to school for three years with a guy named Jake Williams. There's a whole lot of photos of Jake Williams out there, none of them are me.

Which intellectual topic can you just not get into?
<html><body>
<br>Art- in general.
<br>I can certainly appreciate artwork. I can look at a painting of a tree or a dog and think ‘that looks good’. I can understand the effort and skill that goes into producing a piece of art, indeed I have neither the talent nor the patience to produce much more than a stick figure. I can understand the complex social and political issues that can be spoken about using artwork.
<br>Yet, for as long as I live, I will never understand why a Monet or a Van Gogh is worth millions, priceless even, yet an equally impressive piece dolled out by my mate George in his bedroom is near worthless. I will never understand why someone can draw four pen marks on a canvas, and sell it for a six figure sum, while someone can make a hyper realistic charcoal drawing, of skill and beauty beyond what I could ever achieve, and proceed to throw it away or hide it in some folder because it wasn't quite what they were trying to do.
<br>As much as people try to explain it to me, I can never get my head around why this:
<br>Is a masterpiece.
<br>While this:
<br>And this:
<br>And this:
<br>Are considered ‘'amateur’
<br>And because I know I will never understand the system by which it’s decided what has value and what doesn't, I have no interest in learning about that which supposedly has value.

What is the biggest inconvenience you've faced and turned into an advantage?
<html><body>
<br>What can you share on getting ahead when the going gets rough?
<br>As most of my older followers (as well as anyone who's read my older answers) will know, I got bullied badly and was put in a variety of situations during my early teen years. Mainly physical attacks and fights. Not fun. But, I did learn many things. One of the most useful is a keen ability to detect danger.
<br>For example, a couple days ago, I was catching a train with my mum, at night. We got on board and, while she went to sit in a quiet section of the train with a table, I pulled her arm and sat us down in a louder, less comfortable area where we didn't have a table, explaining to her that we should sit there. Naturally, she was confused. It was at that moment that a clearly unstable man (either mental issue or drug use, I couldn't tell) and a woman trying to calm him, came aboard the train. She led him to the quiet section my mum was going to sit in, and he started freaking out, banging his head and throwing things.
<br>I'd spotted him in the station, about 30 metres away from us, and could tell he was potentially violent. I decided that it was best to sit close to other people, and leave a quiet section where the woman would most likely take him. I don't know if there would have been trouble had we sat near where they ended up, but I was able to avoid the risk.
<br>You know, how after something bad happens, people always seem to say ‘you never expect it to happen to you’? I'm the guy who always expects it to happen to me. One important thing to remember, 95% of fights can be stopped before the first punch is thrown.

What skills take less than 5 minutes to learn that everyone should know how to do?
<html><body>
<br>The skills can be related to technology, education, health, food, cooking or anything .
<br>The military alphabet. Learn it, for the love of god, learn it.
<br>Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Juliet, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, Xray, Yankee, Zulu.
<br>How many times have you heard this when someone is trying to communicate a spelling, name, number plate, code, etc.
<br>‘A! A! I said A! A, as in Amy! Okay. D! D! No, not B! D!’
<br>No good.
<br>‘Alpha, Delta, November, Kilo, Zulu!’
<br>Clear as day.
<br>Trust me, it's so useful to learn this shit, yet so few people know it.

What are your most controversial criteria when looking for a romantic partner?
<html><body>
<br>Race, income, "no fatties”, anything.
<br>‘Most controversial’? Okay, I think I have one.
<br>I absolutely will not date ‘girly-girls’.
<br>Trust me, I have nothing against women who choose to express their femininity in a traditional way. You like pink and butterflies, and want a guy to take care of you? Awesome, more power to you. But I personally can't see myself dating a woman who isn't a bit rugged.
<br>Motorcycles, boxing, outdoor activity, martial arts, women in the police/ military, these are the sort of things I look for when selecting a partner. I'm not looking for a princess, I'm looking for a shield maiden.
<br>*Quietly waits for first ‘sounds like you want to date a guy’ comment*

As an adult, if you could get all teenagers to understand one thing, what would it be?
<html><body>
<br>It's really not so bad.
<br>I know, I know, all your life you've been told how much it sucks. You've been told that you're probably going to hate your job. You've been told these are the best days you're ever going to get. You've been told you'll become unhealthy. You've been told you'll lose friends. You've been told you'll be enslaved by debt. You're cynical, I get it, I really do.
<br>But chin up, because the truth is, it does get better. These won't be the best days of your life, the best is yet to come. The reason so many adults say they are is because they've forgotten about the bad bits and selectively remember the best. But one day soon, you're going to have more freedom, more opportunity, and probably more fun than you ever have had before.
<br>Don't let em get you down too much.

What do people not do in zombie apocalypse movies that you would do?
<html><body>
<br>For example…
<br>Do you have an original plan?
Eg: head for an aquarium
<br>Or have you thought of something that is overlooked?
Eg: Hide inside a TV
<br>Is there a vehicle you would pick that no one else ever suggests?
Eg: Hot air balloon
<br>A hiding place no one would think of?
Eg: An abattoir (slaughterhouse)
<br>A way of protecting yourself against zombies that they never use in the movies?
Eg: baseball pitching machines
<br>The cheaters guide to the zombie apocalypse
<br>So you want to actually survive those zambies coming after you, instead of making an entertaining film? This is for you.
</body></html>
What would you do if you found US$500 in a parking lot?
<html><body>
<br>Keep it.
<br>Yes, I know what the ‘right thing’ to do is. I don't care.
<br>I'm not a mug. Here's my options other than pocketing it:
<br>Quite frankly if the owner of the money was careless enough to drop it, I don't see why it should be my responsibility to get it back to them, particularly when there's no way to prove it's theirs. If it was a wallet or a phone, yeah, I'd hand it in. But nothing but cash? There's little chance that's ever going to get back to the owner no matter what I do.
<br>Five hundred bucks is a lot of money to me. I'd no doubt give a chunk of it to charity to make myself feel better, but the rest is mine.
</body></html>
What does it feel like to have your identity stolen?
<html><body>
<br>This account isn't me. This account is actually someone who has nothing better to do than pretend to be me. Suppose I should take it as a compliment.
<br>In all honesty it's a bit annoying because I know that some of my followers are confused by his/ her answers, thinking it's me. But I'm not too bothered, if Quora doesn't remove them soon I will likely report the page for identity theft, which is a serious crime pretty much the world over.
<br>Edit: problem done problemed itself out.

What one sentence can change a life?
<html><body>
<br>‘The universe came into existence almost 14 billion years ago’
<br>I can still hear these words. They were said by Mr. Evans, year 9 physics class. About seven years ago.
<br>I always enjoyed science. Not the science they taught us in school, but the cool sciency things shown on Brainiac and Mythbusters. However it was never something I was going to pursue a career in, truth be told. I found the monotony of remembering chemical names and the types of rock incredibly boring. Up until that point, the plan was to become a police officer. I wasn't even planning on getting a degree, even though I was an overachieving student at school my sister had already gotten a degree and it seemed like more trouble than it was worth, she was still working for barely above minimum wage.
<br>But when I heard that man, a guy who was so passionate and so happy telling us about the wonders of space and time, speak about the grand scale of the universe we inhabit I knew I wanted to be on the cutting edge of discovery. Over the following weeks I watched every show about physics there was, I got a bunch of books and read up on cosmology and quantum mechanics, I even convinced my dad to buy a telescope.
<br>Now, seven years later, I'm well on my way. I'm taking physics at a top level college, I'm meeting amazing people, and I'm still as in awe of the majesty of the universe as I was on that day. Is physics hard work? Absolutely. But I cannot put into words how amazing and rewarding it is to see beyond that which we will never reach, to literally stare back into time and look for answers to the biggest questions mankind has ever asked.
</body></html>
What is your biggest “I've never thought of that ‘in that way’” moment?
<html><body>
<br>Someone once pointed out to me why they thought people so often believe the world is either going to end or be plunged into chaos. It's because they can't cope with thinking everyone after them will have it better.
<br>His argument was that despite the fact life seems to become easier, longer, and less painful as time goes on, people would prefer to believe that they are at the peak. The thought that if they were born just 100 years later they would have fewer worries, more fun, and a better life actually causes unhappiness. They are envious of the future generations who will experience these things.
<br>The solution? Adopt the belief that things are going to get worse soon. Through warfare, environmental damage, or civil unrest, the belief the end is nigh is actually comforting, as people can then believe that they have it as good as it's ever going to get, they can feel like they won life's lottery. That's why every society has some ‘end of the world’ story or another, and why a new thing will bring about our destruction every few years.
<br>I don't know if I agree or not, but it is an interesting idea.
</body></html>
Would Jake Williams run for U.S. President if he could?
<html><body>
<br>I wouldn't bother, I could never win.
<br>I don't mean ‘I couldn't win because I'm not famous or a politician’, I mean even if I was one of the two candidates, I would still lose, guaranteed.
<br>Why? Well let's see:
</body></html>
Is there anything special you’d like people to do at your funeral?
<html><body>
<br>Yeah, the thing I would ask people to do at my funeral is ‘don't come.’ That's not everyone, just certain people who always seem to come but I wouldn't want.
<br>If you are some random acquaintance at work who thinks it's a good way to grab some free food, don't come.
<br>If you are some random relative who never really spoke to me anyway, but feels obligated, don't come.
<br>If you are an ‘old friend’ who couldn't be bothered talking to me for 10 years, but wants a chance to catch up with everyone, don't come.
<br>If you wouldn't come to my house for dinner, if you wouldn't come to help me in a rough spot, why the hell would you come to my funeral?
</body></html>
Do you think President Trump deserves a second chance?
<html><body>
<br>This is, for the most part, a question to those who voted against him, or just plainly dislike him.
<br>Do you know what I think?
<br>I think that Donald J. Trump is President Elect of the United States. I think that he got in there by fair democracy, and I think he intends on staying.
<br>I do not like the man. I don't like his politics, I don't like his personality, I don't like his haircut. I’m anxious to see what he is going to do while in office, and what effects this has. I will be vocal against any actions he takes that I disagree with, but I will respect his authority to do so. I will not turn to hatred, I will not make false claims. I will continue to uphold my own standards of conduct, as well as my belief in the democratic process, despite the fact I would have preferred literally any other major candidate to be in that office.
<br>I think President Trump deserves exactly what he has, the presidency of the United States, on the basis he earned it through legal and democratic means. I do not think he deserves my support, I do not think he deserves my faith, I do not think he deserves my agreement. But whatever my views, he will make the decisions.
</body></html>
If a genie grants you three wishes, what do you intend to wish for?
<html><body>
<br>Remember, you cannot wish for another wish.
<br>Genie: and for your third wish?
<br>Me: (slams fork down after finishing second cheesecake) take a wild fucking guess buddy!
<br>No, okay, (slightly) more serious answer. As a side note, I'm going to wish only for things I want because y’all don't want to read the 100th answer that says ‘world peace’ and ‘happiness for everyone’.
</body></html>
I’m upset that Trump won. What is the positive side that could help me get over it?
<html><body>
</body></html>
You have 1 year left to live, but for each other person you directly kill you gain another year. What do you do?
<html><body>
<br>The years you gain can stack up, as long as you have time left you cannot die.
<br>Note: The killing has to be people in real life.
<br>Play a game of Titanfall, kill 20 people, repeat every 20 years (with a different game if necessary).
<br>Nothing in the terms saying I had to kill them in real life, killing real people in videogames therefore counts.
</body></html>
Do you think it is okay for kids to greet adults by their first name?
<html><body>
<br>I would never have any kid call me anything other than Jake, in any position. Even if I become a teacher at any point. If, for any reason, a child (or, more likely, their parents) insisted it was ‘Mr. Williams’ then I would refer to said child as ‘Master/miss (last name)’.
<br>I am very insistent on this.
<br>Age means jack shit. I do not deserve any extra courtesy or respect now I'm an adult than I did as a kid. I don't ask for it, I don't expect it, I don't want it. Anyone who feels the need to demand respect in the form of titles doesn't deserve it.
<br>‘Sir’s and ‘mister’s are nice, when exchanged equally, but I am above no man, no woman, and no child. If I hear a ‘sir’ or a ‘mister’ I respond in kind.
</body></html>
Why don't people like having their picture taken?
<html><body>
<br>I don't see the purpose of it.
<br>There are some photos of me, I mean my great grandkids need something to pretend to be interested in, but I usually prefer to take photos containing something other than the same face I see every time I brush my teeth.
<br>Here's some photos I took in Iceland:
<br>I fail to see how these would be improved by the presence of my face.
<br>On a side note, anyone who says you can't take good pictures on an iPhone is lying to you.

For 12 hours everyone is allowed to take any illegal action without being incriminated: what would you do?
<html><body>
<br>This doesn’t mean that you won’t be seen and that no one would ever know what you did, this might be or not. You just wouldn’t be prosecuted.
<br>Unlike in the movie The Purge, such thing would occur only once.
<br>Step one: grab bow, arrows, quiver, kukri, and body armour (all within 2 minutes access of my current location)
<br>Step two: leave immediate area, abandoning any possessions besides those mentioned
<br>Step three: head towards forest, shoot anyone who approaches me
<br>Step four: hide for next 12 hours

What are your nine levels of hell?
<html><body>
<br>I have a project for my lit class where we need to come up with our own and I’m interested in what the fine people of Quora come up with. Who would guide you through hell?
<br>Level one: The shower that is too hot or too cold
<br>This consists of standing in a shower with a little valve. Clockwise is hot, anticlockwise is cold. Except, it's freezing cold until you turn it to a certain point, and then it suddenly becomes boiling hot. And like, you know there's a comfortable bit in the middle, it's just 0.2 nanometres big. And once you find it, someone flushes the downstairs toilet.
<br>Level two: The long car journey with no bathroom stops
<br>‘We’re making good time’ the driver will reply every time you ask him to stop at the next services. Sure you could pee into a bottle, except for the fact there isn't one. Don't worry, only 68 miles left to go. Shouldn't have drunk so much coffee earlier, should you.
<br>Level three: The disappointed gran
<br>You never call, you know you don't. You sent her birthday card too late and it arrived the day after. You didn't call her then either. You haven't visited in a while, almost six months now. And you never wrote a thank you note after she sent you a jumper for your birthday. It's okay dear, she's not mad, she's just disappointed.
<br>Level four: The bleep
<br>You're trying to get to sleep; just about to nod off when ‘bleep bleep’. What was that? You decide to ignore it. After a couple of minutes ‘bleep bleep’ there it is again. Must be the fire alarm, maybe the microwave. You go to check it out, but after walking around for five minutes it seems to have stopped. You get back into bed. ‘Bleep bleep’. You go back to investigating. What is it. After twenty minutes of looking ‘bleep bleep’ it's coming from the living room. What on earth is it? The only things in here are the phone, the TV, and the stereo. Must be one of them. You mess around with all three, and elect to unplug the stereo for good measure. That seems to have done it. You finally go back to bed. ‘Bleep bleep’.
<br>Level five: The slow talker.
<br>You're at a very important meeting. You need to focus. You're also in a bit of a rush to get home in time to watch the footy. The speaker comes up. ‘Hello… my name… is John… I am here… today… to talk about… marketing… and… erm… where's my pen? Erm… ah… there it is… yes… where was I? Well… my name is John…’
<br>Level six: The guy you work with who isn't quite racist enough to call out.
<br>‘So I saw this coloured guy…’
<br>‘I was stuck behind a stupid Asian driver and…’
<br>‘I don't mind Indian doctors, it's just…’
<br>‘The problem with the Spanish is…’
<br>‘I'm not racist- but…’
<br>You have to listen to these, and more, day in day out.
<br>Level seven: Corn
<br>A little bit of corn. Stuck between your teeth. And there's no toothpicks or floss around.
<br>Level eight: Baby on a plane
<br>And you're sat next to them. Twelve hour flight. They have no intention of not crying. You forget to bring headphones.
<br>Level nine: Hangnail
<br>Need I say more?
</body></html>
Has a person ever said something to you that made you rethink your life?
<html><body>
<br>“Let the man through.”
<br>-a random woman to her daughter, referring to me, when I was 17.
<br>It was the first time someone referred to me as a man without irony or prephrasing it with the words ‘young’ or ‘little’. Guess I suddenly realised I wasn't a kid anymore.
</body></html>
Why does Jake Williams keep his privacy?
<html><body>
<br>Jake is an exceptional writer that I avidly follow and I am pretty sure he would be well respected wherever he went. So Why does he choose to keep his privacy?
<br>Because, what sort of person would I be if I didn't?
<br>Sure, right now I could reveal all. I could type my home address right here, take a selfie, and submit this answer. I have the ability, there's nothing stopping me. But that would change how I'm seen.
<br>I want you to close your eyes and picture ‘Jake Williams’ in your head (I know you're not doing it). What do you see? Maybe my profile picture, maybe some non descript 20 year old white bloke, maybe even someone that I remind you of. If someone asked you about me, none of that would help. So you are forced to consider my writing, you are forced to consider what I've said, in a way my answers here are me.
<br>I don't want to replace all of that with the image of myself, I'm more than that.
</body></html>
What should one do in their 20s to avoid regrets in their 30s and 40s?
<html><body>
</body></html>
What would change if you were to become an atheist?
<html><body>
<br>I have a friend. He is religious.
<br>We commonly spoke about religion. He would come up with an argument, I would come up with one, and we would debate for hours. It was a pretend case of trying to convince each other; we knew it would never happen though, my atheism was too strong and so was his faith.
<br>Then it happened.
<br>I got a phone call. He sounded destitute. He asked me to come over, and I did so immediately.
<br>He told me I was right, there was no god. Then he broke down and cried. And cried. And cried. He kept asking me questions I hadn't the heart to answer ‘where's my dad?’ (his dad had died), ‘why does no one care about me?’, ‘what can I do now?’
<br>I pointed him to the church. I told him to ask his pastor, speak to him about it. I told him to pray, and he would find the answer.
<br>He's back in the fold now, in fact he works as a minister. That boy needs religion more than this world needs another atheist. We don't talk about religion anymore, I wouldn't dare.
</body></html>
What would telemarketers do if a child answered the phone?
<html><body>
<br>Or someone that sounds like a child. Do share your experiences, and a mix of perspectives (children, parents and telemarketers) is greatly appreciated. :)
<br>Once when I was a teenager I got a call from a telemarketer on my mobile. I knew what to do, I'd seen a comedy sketch. Here's roughly how it went.
<br>Him: Hello there, my name is John and I'm with service bay motors (or some similar sounding company)
<br>Me: Hi there.
<br>Him: I'd just like to ask you a few questions for a survey.
<br>Me: Could you call me back in a few minutes? (hoping he would just go)
<br>Him: Sure.
<br>So he calls me back, much to my annoyance, I decide to have some fun
<br>Him: Okay, are you free to answer some questions?
<br>Me: Well we could do that, but I'd much rather you buy me dinner first
<br>Him: Excuse me sir?
<br>Me: We could get to know each other, maybe share dessert
<br>Him: Sir I just need you to answer some questions
<br>Me: Of course, of course. I'm a little busy right now though, could you call me back in about half an hour.
<br>Him: Certainly, sir.
<br>About half an hour passed, and I got another call, thankfully from the same guy.
<br>Me: Ah John, have you reconsidered my offer for dinner?
<br>Him: Erm…
<br>Me (interrupting): I think it would be really romantic, I know a lovely Italian place.
<br>Him: Sir I don't think that would be appropriate…
<br>Me: Well, if you want to be quiet about it, we could just meet at my place and have some fun there.
<br>Him: Sir, I believe this is harassment.
<br>Me: Mate, you've called me three times in the past hour, who's harassing who?
<br>He hung up.
<br>Edit:
<br>A few people seem to believe it was immoral or unwarranted of me to waste this guys time like this. Let me put it this way, if someone chooses to call me, on my phone, to use my time for their own purposes, I don't care if it's their job, I will fuck with them to the best of my ability. I'm not saying that telemarketers are bad people, I'm saying that by doing what they do (even if it's their job) they cause people annoyance and waste people's time. If someone tries to do this to me, I will do the same to them. And before someone says that the couple seconds it would have taken to say ‘no thanks’ doesn't equal the amount of time I wasted of his, let me state clearly I do not believe in like-for-like response, I do not believe in an eye for an eye; I believe in massive retaliation.

Who's the most badass friend you have, and why?
<html><body>
<br>I'm guessing I got A2Aed this because someone wants to hear more about Jade (that is her real name)
<br>So, let's get to some stories:
<br>Now I don't know what image you might have in your head. I'm assuming you think she's some big woman who looks like Rhonda Rousey. I can assure you that Jade is five foot two and weighs no more than a buck ten.
<br>Do not fuck with Jade.

If you had just one question to ask to save you before getting killed, what would it be?
<html><body>
<br>Top contenders include:
</body></html>
When walking with a female friend, do you feel a sense of ownership towards her body?
<html><body>
<br>Do you perceive a threat to her wellbeing (for example, a ‘creep’ cat-calling her) as a threat to one of your ‘possessions’? I do not, and I think that this twisted interpretation of the unconscious motivations of protective men veers from benevolent sexism to misandry.
<br>If I was with any of my female friends, and some dude started creeping on them, you can bet your ass I'd get him to back off.
<br>Not out of a sense of possession though, but out of loyalty. No one fucks with my friends on my watch. Male, female, if they have a problem that can be solved with a little conflict, I'm more than happy to oblige.
<br>Well, all my female friends except for Jade. Jade is scarier than I; she fights her own battles. Don't fuck with Jade.

If dogs had Quora, what kind of questions would they ask?
<html><body>
<br>“What if humans only throw the ball because they think we enjoy chasing it?’
<br>“The poodle across the way howled at me; does she like me?”
<br>“Do black labs actually get fewer treats than white labs?”
<br>“I'm four years old, is it too late for me to learn to play the guitar?”
<br>“Cats don't get as many walks as dogs, are they inferior to me?”
<br>“My owner petted the dog next door, does this count as cheating? Should I get revenge by accepting treats off of the mailman, making him jealous?”
<br>“I only eat half a tin of food and a small bowl of kibble a day, but I'm still gaining weight please help?”
<br>“Why does my human go out for eight hours a day, is he on a walk that he doesn't take me on?”
<br>“Will Donald Trump really build a wall, and if so can I pee on it?”
<br>“Who IS a good boy?!”

What is something you’ve done that most people haven’t?
<html><body>
</body></html>
Which fictional character scares you the most and why?
<html><body>
<br>Jason, Far Cry 3.
<br>Now I know what you're thinking ‘a human protagonist? The hero of the story, the guy that slays the villain and frees his friends? How on earth does that guy scare you more than the monsters and the aliens?’
<br>Because Jason Brody is who I fear I could become; who I know I could become.
<br>Trapped on an island filled with murderous neo-pirates, Jason must learn to become a warrior to gain his salvation. He stops fearing the island first, then he stops becoming disgusted by the killings he performs, and then he starts to like it.
<br>Jason is a sociopath with a bloodlust and few to no restraints. He becomes an animal, ending countless lives and forgetting his cause in the process. Human suffering becomes meaningless to him, and he begins to take pleasure in the victories he scores.
<br>And still, we view him as the hero. His victories become our victories. We justify it. It's a game.
<br>Fear not the evil which lies outside your door; fear the evil that lies within your heart. Fear that which you might become.

How good is Eminem?
<html><body>
<br>Eminem is to rap what David Beckham is to football.
<br>He might not be the best.
<br>He might not be the first.
<br>He might not be the most talented.
<br>But goddamn, his success should speak for itself. Nobody does it like he does it. And if you don't know his name, you must be living under a rock.

Is it true that the first kill is the hardest?
<html><body>
<br>Let me share a true story with you.
<br>In Afghanistan, there was a man digging by the side of the road. He was a local man, and just like most of the locals, had loose clothing, dark skin, and a beard. And here he was, by the side of the road, with a shovel and a bag, randomly digging. This was inside the green zone (the lush area near the Helmand River).
<br>Meanwhile, a British private could see him. Let's call him the FNG. He was armed with a GPMG, accurate up to around 600 metres. This guy was young and new, barely old enough to grow facial hair, in the first few weeks of his first tour. It would be accurate to describe him as ‘scared shitless of everything’. Now this FNG had heard many stories about roadside bombs, in fact part of his brief before going to Afghan was that roadside bombs are dangerous and bad. He was going to be a hero! He would kill this evil Tally, and save himself and his fellow soldiers.
<br>So FNG takes aim towards this man digging. That is when a captain, we’ll call him Cap, yells ‘hold fire’. FNG follows the order, and lowers his weapon, giving the classic ‘WTF sir?’ look. Cap then asks FNG what the man is doing. FNG replies ‘planting a bomb sir’. Cap informs FNG that he is wrong, and asks him again, what the man is doing. FNG replies ‘digging, sir’. FNG is then sent out, with a sergeant and his section, to investigate the matter. It turns out the man's village had flooded, and he was digging to divert the flood waters.
<br>Killing is easy, I think a lot of people would be surprised how easily people take lives. Sparing a life, on the other hand, that takes a lot.

How rich is Jake Williams?
<html><body>
<br>I'm broke.
<br>Like, seriously, I checked my bank balance this morning and there's less than £300 in there. No, I don't have a savings account. Ah, the student life. Thank god mum loves me, else I may not be able to eat.
<br>Of course, if you like you can help. Just deposit £500 (or your currency’s equivalent) into my bank account. In return, I will tag you in this answer. Fair?

Atheists and theists: If all religions were correct, which one do you pick?
<html><body>
<br>supposition: Any or all gods from all religions came down to earth, showed themselves to humans, and said that every religion is correct, aka if you are a good christian you go to heaven, if you are a taoist you don’t go to hell, your consequences will be depending on the taoist scripts, etc etc…
<br>Hmm, let me think this through.
<br>If I choose Islam or Christianity I'm royally fucked. Like seriously, I've already sinned way way too much. Besides, all the praying and confessing and all that would seriously bore me.
<br>I would stay away from the Greek gods. Their expectations are way too high, they are totally unforgiving, and their afterlife is meh.
<br>I wouldn't mind coming back, so maybe Buddhism or Hinduism. It'd be one to think about.
<br>But realistically, I think I know what I would do.
<br>‘Hey, erm, Odin? Odin? Ah, there you are. I think I'm going to go with you. I just need to die in battle, right?’
<br>Then, I would get on the next plane to Turkey and purchase some weaponry. From there I would drive to Syria, and start hunting ISIS members. Pretty soon one of them will kill me. Then I get to spend eternity drinking, feasting, and fighting in the hall of Valhalla or the fields of Fólkvangr. I'm pretty sure the Vikings had mead, right? Maybe by this point they'll have jägers up there too.

What would Jake Williams do if someone showed up outside his house and told him that they are a fan from Quora?
<html><body>
<br>Well first I'd congratulate them on tracking me down. I mean, there's a lot of houses in the Forest of Dean, and I'm not listed on white pages because it's not listed as my official residence. Whoever found me is good.
<br>Then of course I'd call the police and prosecute for harassment. That be some creepy ass shit.

If I attract not-so-attractive guys, does that mean that I'm not attractive?
<html><body>
<br>Just curious and for funsies.
<br>But, really, many people wonder about this…
<br>I like beer.
<br>As in, I really like beer.
<br>I usually drink a Japanese beer (it's called Asahi 朝日 and it's delicious).
<br>As a beer connoisseur I am much more well versed in beer than someone who doesn't drink beer, such as my mum.
<br>Yesterday though, I gave my mum an Asahi and she remarked ‘oh that's lovely’.
<br>If something is good, anyone is capable of figuring that out. No qualifications required.

What are the strangest and funniest misconceptions about your country?
<html><body>
<br>UK
</body></html>
Quora, Reddit, 4chan, and tumblr are now their own countries. What does life look like in each?
<html><body>
<br>How are they governed? What is their culture? What is their relationship with the other countries (websites)? What laws do they have? Ect.
<br>Quora is like Japan. Efficient, well organised, but filled with rules. Both government rules and social rules. A lot of things you can and can't do, and in different situations.
<br>Reddit is like the United States. Everyone can do pretty much what they want, the right to express yourself is protected, and there's no small amount of internal conflict between groups.
<br>Tumblr is like the UK. A few radically different areas united by a common goal (though no one knows what that goal actually is). Also a shitload of eccentrics.
</body></html>
What are some cool psychological hacks?
<html><body>
<br>One thing that I have learned about public speaking, or even just persuasive speaking, which I think falls into psychological.
<br>When talking about something, you need to own your space. You can do this in many ways, but the best way to get people to listen to what you say is to own the space around you. Show confidence, show that you're comfortable. Convince others ‘I am so sure what I'm saying is awesome and true that I am not in the least bit nervous about this speech.’
<br>Walking around is one way to do it. Use up all of the stage. Move. Lean down, stand up, walk to the front, walk to the back. Just be careful not to overdo it, otherwise it might seem more like fidgeting which will have the opposite effect.
<br>Open yourself up. Spread your shoulders, lift your head, widen your stance. Don't take my word for it, just look at the man himself:
<br>Uncrossed legs, relaxed stance, chin up, shoulders back. This is how you want to look.
<br>Another little hack to achieve the ‘I know what I'm talking about’ effect is to bring a drink with you. It shows you're calm, allows you to take a little rest, pauses show that you're thinking about what you're saying. Depending on the drink, it can also show confidence in of itself. Trust me, a glass of whiskey can make for a powerful prop.

What is the most courageous thing you have seen somebody do?
<html><body>
<br>I was new to a school. New year for everyone else.
<br>If you thought this was yet another story from my dramatic teenage years, you were wrong. I was seven.
<br>There was a boy in this class. Let's call him Lewis. Lewis was… let's just say he wasn't very popular. He wasn't bullied, he wasn't hated, he was just a loner. The sort of kid who no one really talked to, and who didn't really talk to anyone (he would grow up to be the most mad cap son of a bitch I know).
<br>One day Lewis decides to read a book. I cannot recall what book, only that it had a bright pink cover.
<br>Another kid, let's call him Darren, decides that this is a perfect opportunity to do what kids do best: be cruel. So he goes to mock Lewis.
<br>‘You're reading a girls book. You like girly things!’
<br>I've been observing Lewis for several days now. I've always liked to observe those that stood out to me. Even at my age I was able to tell that Lewis was not the sort of kid who would be able to respond well to that.
<br>Except I was wrong.
<br>‘Yeah I'm reading a girly book. I also like fairy cakes. And I love my mum. What are you going to do about it?’
<br>Y'all know what sort of person I am. Now. But this kid was 7 years old and totally owned who he was. Not only that, but he took what must've been the greatest risk I'd ever seen right there.

How do you define Capitalism, Socialism and Communism in one line?
<html><body>
<br>Capitalism: I have three cows and you have one cow, because I worked harder than you.
<br>Socialism: I have one cow and you have one cow because we both worked hard.
<br>Communism: If we had ten cows, we would share them. Alas, we have no cows.

What don't teenagers understand about adulthood?
<html><body>
<br>Feel free to answer if you’re in that in-between age of 18–20 as well.
<br>I see a metric fuckton of negative answers here.
<br>You want to know what most teenagers don't seem to get about adulthood? Few, if any, opportunities go away.
<br>Y'all think that you need to get laid now. That if you don't drink now, smoke pot now, fall in love now, party now, get in trouble now, have a bunch of friends now, and find yourself now, that somehow those experiences are going to mean less when you finally do them.
<br>There's still parties when you're an adult. Finding alcohol to drink, weed to smoke, and hot guys and girls to fuck is a hell of a lot easier when you're an adult. All those things you ‘missed out’ on in high school? They still exist. Except now everyone around you is more responsible and that makes it a lot more fun.
<br>Responsibilities? Yes.
<br>Work? Yes.
<br>The sudden disappearance of everything fun and cool? No.
<br>And if, as an adult, you've found yourself doing stupid, fun, exciting things less, that's a choice you made.

How can I improve my sarcasm skills?
<html><body>
<br>There's two main types of bad sarcasm.
<br>The first kind is where no one knows you're being sarcastic. This lands you in a real life Poe’s law where you need to convince people after the fact you were being sarcastic. Not funny.
<br>The second kind of bad sarcasm is where you need to completely change the way you say something just so people know you're being sarcastic.
<br>True sarcasm, the mastery of sarcasm, is where you are able to make it obvious you're being sarcastic, while saying it like you're serious.
<br>The only other thing to master once you've got that is targets. Be sarcastic towards someone who you know is going to not only get your sarcasm, but find it amusing. If you can insult someone and make them happy at the same time, you've got it.

What was the most embarrassing moment in front of your parents?
<html><body>
<br>I could answer with my mum asking ‘why is there a photo on Facebook of you as a fox?’ (Thanks to my cousin sharing the image haha)
<br>I could answer with the time I spent ten minutes alone in the bathroom for no admitable reason thinking I was home alone, only to leave with my dad waiting outside, giving me a look.
<br>I could answer with the embarrassment-by-proxy I felt when my parents found a dildo in my brothers room.
<br>But no. My story is more embarrassing, more shameful, than all those put together. And it could have been a lot worse.
<br>So to paint a picture, I'm a young teen who's discovered porn and not yet discovered how search history works. Naturally, I've been on a few sites and looked at a few videos. Well, believe it or not, I hear ‘how the fuck did all of this porn get here?!’ It's my dad. Sat with the family laptop open.
<br>My face: O_O
<br>My brother casually glances at me, not sure whether to laugh or cry, for he knows exactly what's up.
<br>My dad marches in, and looks at both of us. I know exactly whats coming, it's obvious who's responsible. My brother opens his mouth, I'm expecting his usual snarky comment.
<br>“Shit did I forget to clear it?”
<br>My face: o_o
<br>My dad “That's disgusting. And use your phone for fucks sake, not my laptop.”
<br>I get a glance, I've managed to put on a face like I find it funny despite the fact my heart is going a million miles an hour.
<br>Once my dads gone, I get a dead arm and a lecture on how to clear history from my brother.
<br>Thanks bro, that's taking one for the team, I owe you one.

What are your 7 worst habits?
<html><body>
</body></html>
What equipment do infantry soldiers still have that's practically obsolete in the modern battlefield?
<html><body>
<br>Probably this:
<br>Soldiers are, usually, expected to be well groomed. Short hair, clean shaven, etc. etc. This carries over onto the battlefield. Most soldiers will still maintain short facial hair, and are often expected to.
<br>However an interesting thing to note is that, from personal anecdotes, soldiers who have beards get more respect from locals in many Middle Eastern countries. My dad, on his last tour in Afganistan, was one of the oldest men there (he was a year into a two year extension), and he had a large beard. It would seem based on these two things the local people were more willing to talk to him than the other soldiers.
<br>Makes sense, most men in rural Afganistan have large beards and they are somewhat of a status symbol. As such, they'd rather talk to someone with the same than a clean shaven person who reminds them of the west that many of them aren't exactly fond of.

Is God an artist or an engineer?
<html><body>
<br>He's not an engineer, I know that much.
<br>I mean, take a human for example. The appendix shows over-engineering, the skin shows under-engineering. The heart is inefficient as a machine. Running temperatures do not match those found under uncontrolled conditions. Improvement to systems can only be done by damage to them. Maintenance is such a hassle that we need dedicated repairmen that earn two or three times the average wage. There is no standardised fuel, so a fine mixture is required. The individual systems are so co-dependent that switching one off for a few seconds will lead to permanent damage to the others. Parts are often not interchangeable, and where they are efficiency goes down. And to top it off, you get an average life of only around 80 years even under perfect conditions.
<br>God isn't an artist or an engineer. He's a comedian.

What were you good at that nobody cares about now?
<html><body>
<br>Snake.
<br>Remember this game from the days before the smartphones?

<br>Now? Now everyone has those damn smartphones and are too busy on the Internet and social media. Well not me!

Would you give up one foot of your height for $10 million?
<html><body>
<br>You’d also keep your penis length, if you have one.
<br>I see no good reason why not.
<br>Sure at five foot I would be on the shorter side for a man, but with ten million I would also be on the richer side. Five foot looks pretty damn good when it's inside a Lamborghini.
</body></html>
What is the biggest lie society has taught you to believe?
<html><body>
<br>Others are out to get you
<br>This is screamed at us since childhood. It starts with ‘don't talk to strangers’ and ends with ‘work against your peers’. Constantly we are told that other people are for themselves and against us. Our colleagues are out to get that promotion, our friends are out to get our time, our lovers want… Something!
<br>I hear a lot of people saying ‘I'm a nice person, but I feel like I'm the only one’. The truth is, most people are a lot like us. Most people want to help others, and feel bad when they hurt someone else. Most people want to be nice, and kind, and respectable. Most people want to think of themselves as good and not bad. And most people are.
<br>Trust. We need more trust in this world. People aren't as bad as we give them credit for.
