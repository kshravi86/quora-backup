Why is Karnataka unique?
<html><body>
<br>The state is a complete package when it comes to travel. It has brilliant beaches, great waterfalls, amazing hill stations, ancient historical temples, grand palaces, coffee plantations, religious pilgrimage, national parks and a great metropolis. No other state has this complete a package.
<br>It is also a state that borders 6 other states with equal number of cultures. In each region you can see each cultural influence. The shared Konkani culture of the northern coast, the Tulu culture of the southern coast, the Tamil culture in the south, the Telugu culture in the east and Marathi culture in the north all add facets of the state’s unique culture.
<br>The state is also quite accepting and all together the diversity makes it a mini-India.

What is your opinion on Manohar Parrikar resigning as the Defence Minister to become the CM of Goa?
<html><body>
<br>It points to the dire need in BJP to groom the next-gen leaders who can replace Modi, Parrikar, Rajnath Singh etc. Parrikar had to be sent to secure his home base as there was no one with charisma left in the Goa politics.
<br>BJP’s big problem is its lack of sufficient depth when it comes to pragmatic politics. It is like the Indian cricket team of 1990s. Too much reliance on Sachin and Kumble. If you need to rule 25 states and the centre, you need 50 excellent leaders [25 CMs + 25 union ministers] who can not just administer, but also can do excellent alliance making. Parrikar is an example of someone who can do both.
<br>They need to have a 10 year plan and start grooming 50 such Parrikars. Otherwise such sad things happen. Hopefully the Defense ministry doesn’t go back to its old ways.
<br>Goa is important for BJP to retain as it is a forward base from which they can enter into the south. Their strategists were bit too complacent about the state during the elections as they were all focused on UP. If BJP leaves Goa to Congress, it might make it a little more tricky to replace Congress in Karnataka in 2018. The coastal and northern Karnataka, adjoining Goa, is usually the stronghold of BJP and they have to hold that.
</body></html>
Congress has a majority in 3 out of 5 states. Even so, why should I call this a victory of the BJP?
<html><body>
<br>Everybody is talking about huge victory of BJP in UP. But when I see it as whole, 3 out of 5 states are not in their favour. Why should I call it victory? Does opinion of only bigger states matter? Amit Shah announced that they will form government in Goa & Manipur. How do I understand this?
<br>It is considered a big victory for BJP because:
<br>There is so much to celebrate. One can celebrate victory, accept defeat or close eyes & pretend nothing happened. It is up to that person and being a free country you are free to say anything. But, for the rest of us it is Holi time.
</body></html>
What's the reason behind Akhilesh Yadav’s loss in UP?
<html><body>
<br>Indian opposition parties seem to drastically underestimate the popularity of Modi and demonetization. (Mis)Guided by a skewed media they are bowling head-on into the strongest areas of BJP. Their strategies were way off and getting onto silly stuff.
<br>If you have to win BJP you have to ask tough, pertinent, uncomfortable questions that even BJP supporters cannot reject outright. Rather than some stupid stereotyping — “fascist party”, “organized loot”, “anti-Muslim”, “Hindu terrorism”, the opposition leaders should learn to use the grey matter between the ears. The communal card is no longer working and rather than speaking in Yadav-Muslim or Dalit-Muslim terms, speak in terms of real issues relevant to the people.
<br>Some of the pertinent questions they didn’t ask enough was — “Who is the BJP’s CM candidate?”, “What has BJP done to UP since winning in 2014?”, “What is the success of key policies like Make in India?” etc. If you ask these in neutral tone without accusation it will be like Glen McGrath bowling on off stump. That is what is tripping BJP in Goa. If you start having colourful adjectives and unrelated European ideologies [fascism?] you will get a deaf ear and get out hit-wicket.
<br>Now, coming back to BJP’s win:
</body></html>
Of all the Indian Prime Ministers you've seen in your life, whom do you respect the most and why?
<html><body>
<br>I have lived through the rule of Rajiv, VP Singh, Rao, Gowda, Gujral, Vajpayee, MMS and Modi.
<br>Rajiv was a disaster and the worst ever Prime Minister of India. Nobody was even close. Handling Kashmir, IPKF, Bhopal crisis, Sikh carnage & terrorism, Ramjanamboomi, Shah Bano, Satanic Verses all showed that he was totally clueless. Within a single term he turned a historic win into a highly embarrassing defeat.
<br>I liked Gujral, but we didn’t see a lot of him. With Modi I like the going so far, but it is too early to make a call. VP Singh and Gowda were just average. MMS started off well in his first term and by the end of his second term he was a nightmare. He handed Congress its worst ever defeat and made it not even qualify for the main opposition party.
<br>That leaves the contest between Rao and Vajpayee. Rao was spectacular in the first 3 years when the pressure was on him. Brilliant decision making guided through a star team. But, in his last two years of the term he turned into a ghost. He abruptly slowed down the liberalization in 1994 and his government was ridden with some of the nastiest scams of the time - hawala, fodder, jmm.
<br>Vajpayee had his issues - his government was partly blemished in the scam unearthed by Tehelka, but nothing as big as those in the preceding and following governments. He didn’t forsee trouble in Kargil. However, overall his term was quite good and consistent. Stock markets kept rising and gave his successor a great momentum. India turned nuclear and got to the big leagues. Kargil war was decisively ended. Relationship with the west significantly improved.
</body></html>
Why India was captured and ruled by many? Example -British, Muslim rule, Others like French, Dutch, Portuguese.. Are Indians so weak?
<html><body>
<br>The question previously said are Indians or Hindus so weak?
<br>But the terms are not even close to synonymous. Hence I corrected it to are Indians so weak?
<br>Contrary to the myth, India is not a country easily conquered. The powerful Achaemenid Empire [could be the first known superpower of the world] could not cross into India. And same for Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan. The unconquerable Arabs under the Caliphates were stopped around the Indus river. Over 5000 years of civilization, hardly a few managed to invade India.
<br>The only ones to conquer sufficient territory - Mughal Empire and British Empire - did during the last 500 years [not that long given the length of our history] and even these two could do that because they were mostly content on not changing much. Both empires were more content on trade than on cultural change. India’s core culture was barely touched for the most part, except for the reign of Aurangzeb.
<br>This is why India is the only ancient civilization to continue its religion, culture, language and social systems as they were 3000 years ago. Contrast that with Persia, which has been through far brutal invasions losing a massive chunk of its population and its native religions. Hinduism’s sibling, Zoroastrianism [Parsee religion] has been mostly wiped off Iran. Or think of Britain that has been through a series of invasions for over 1000 years - changing its language and culture multiple times. The original celtic languages are now a minority in Britain. Think of Egypt, Iraq and Greece. Where is their original culture from those great bronze & iron age past? Those are studied in museums now.
<br>There is not a single major country that was left undefeated. If something was worth defeating, it would have been defeated. England was among the most invaded countries - invaded by Romans, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Vikings and Normans. And England has been among the strongest invader countries. Russia has been invaded and so were China and other countries. If a region has not been invaded enough, it probably didn’t have much use - like Antartica.
<br>India had a lot of use and thus was invaded, but for the most part India has resisted any kind of invasion. While Indian school history books often show people outside attacking, they don’t show how we defended. Of the glorious battles of Porus [against Alexander] or of Alaudin Khilji [against Mongols]. Of the legendary Chalukyas & other members of the alliance that stopped the Arab caliphates in Rajasthan, or of the Vijayanagara Empire that rebuilt south Indian temples and culture of an onslaught by the Delhi Sultanates. We don’t talk much about the heroic fight of people like Hemu or of legendary fight back like that of the Maratha & Sikh empires. India is not a culture to go without a fight.
<br>If people felt that their culture was even barely touched, they would end even the largest of entities. British East India Company was the largest ever corporation, but once it tried intruding into Indian culture, it was thrown off India and became bankrupt soon [now run as a tea shop by an Indian]. Same for Mughal empire - whose last major emperor Aurangzeb tried to bring some discriminatory religious laws and got his empire to implode in no time.

What do you think about recent Ramjas College Violence incident?
<html><body>
<br>First, relatively minor matters that happen in/around Delhi get far more national attention than big things elsewhere. Rapes and murders in other regions don’t get anywhere near the national attention of what Nirbhaya’s or Dadri lynching got. Altercations between student groups in Delhi colleges are covered in the front pages as though it is the Syrian war. Much ado about nothing!
<br>Second, the students on both sides are mere pawns in the big game of thoughts between the right and left. From Rijiju to Sitaram Yechury everyone tries to jump into relevance using what is a mere internal college matter. For newsmedia, it is the TRP - and more the shouting better the cash. If the shouting happens closer to their Delhi home even better, they can save a lot of operational expenses in having reporters travel far.
<br>Third, young students are thrust into big league politics well before they are ready. I can sympathize with the plight of Gurmehar. She just made a small video and whether you like the content or not, it is her right of expression. Students say crazy shit all the time. Both sides treated as though it is a President’s address to the nation on the Republic Day. The left kept sharing the post as though it is the most important revelation to mankind since Moses brought down the 10 Commandments on 2 clay tablets. The right kept fighting as though ISIS is right down on our borders. Silliness everywhere!
<br>I have always cautioned about high voltage power politics. If you are not ready for it, you will be burned by it. I have never gone that viral, that controversial or that popular, but even within the limited confines of my social media, I get viciously trolled and abused. I can only imagine the kind of brutality a poor 20-year old had to face with this sudden rise to national front pages.
<br>Fourth, there is an ever growing gulf between the left and right. Both sides don’t even try to stand the other’s thought. For the ABVP, everything, even some irrelevant talk by some unknown speaker seems to be a threat to the nation. They demean our nation thinking it as that fragile. The leftist student groups are “antinationals” from whom the country is to be saved. For the left, any rightwing leaning student is not a student at all - just a “goonda”. Aren’t those guys students too and have the leftwing students unions never engaged in violence & destruction to property? Both sides have scant respect for each other - and the mediamen are cheerleaders in those whole thing - building up the stereotypes and adding noise.
<br>On the whole, an unnecessary drama making a mountain out of a molehill, whose only beneficiary is the Delhi media.
</body></html>
Is Shashi Tharoor like Karna of Mahabaharata, who's right in his views but assisting the wrong side?
<html><body>
<br>Every system, every leader, every corporation needs a pool of highly smart thinkers who don’t have the ambition for the big thing. Kings and entrepreneurs and religious heads have used these highly smart people as their advisors. These folks will not bend usually when it comes to their academic areas, but are quite bendable in other areas where they don’t have expertise. This is where they differ from the normal folk. Normal folk will neither have that much confidence in a particular area, nor be that unconfident in a particular area. In contrast, such advisors are extremely malleable and ductile.
<br>These smart folks know their limits and know that they don’t have any powers on their own. They know that they need the patronage of those in power. In the past, Brahmin community did that job - they won’t get in the way of power and will be loyal to their patrons.
<br>Shashi Tharoor and Manmohan Singh are examples of these in the modern day. They are smart, but also know that they are nothing without their patrons. They know that they can neither manage the power nor fight the power. They provide advice and consultation to their masters - whoever they initially signed up to and are too afraid to even let go of that first master. They are not heroes in any sense.
<br>We have a whole army of such advisors and smart consultants circling any corridor of power - Delhi, Washington DC, Brussels, London etc. Without them those in power will be completely lost.

How will our world be today, if the 20th century didn't witness the 2 world wars?
<html><body>
</body></html>
If Ancient Indian military was so sophisticated, then how did they lose to Arab invaders?
<html><body>
<br>India didn’t lose to Arabs. The unstoppable Arab caliphates who controlled everything from Spain to Southern Italy could not get past the Indus. The Ummayads came a bit into Sindh later and that’s about it. This is one reason why the majority of India didn’t turn Islamic.
<br>Many centuries later, the Afghans/Uzbeks captured parts of North India after the collapse of major Indian empires. Afghanistan, being traditionally a part of Indian culture had a better access to north India and vice versa. Otherwise it was very hard for any outsider to win over India. After a few centuries of tussle, the Mughal dynasty was formed which then gave way to the British empire that collapsed under 2 centuries.
<br>Also, the time period you are talking about is not “ancient”. It is medieval and in the late medieval era North India didn’t have a major home grown empire after the fall of the Palas. It was this vacuum that the central Asian dynasties used.
<br>In the ancient India, not many outsiders came past the Indus. The exception is probably the Kushan empire that adopted a lot of the Sanskritian culture as it moved from Central Asia to Afghanistan to eventually rule a lot of North India.

Do Microsoft employees use Google at the office?
<html><body>
<br>About 11 years ago when I was interviewed at Microsoft I had the similar question. Once I joined there I found that the Microsoft culture was quite open in accepting competitor’s products. While Google’s tools were used extensively, in some teams [like Live Labs back in the days] people used Macs as their official boxes and played on Nintendo Wii. The leaders were more confident to let that be. Although on one occasion my request to use Mediawiki for an internal project was shot down by IT - who wanted to push Sharepoint.
<br>Even in the Live teams [back in the day before it was renamed to Bing] people used Google extensively. After Bing was launched, the leaders in the company pleaded to use an internal tool that would open both the search engines side by side. It just showed how far Bing was when it came to the long-tail keywords.
<br>Over the years Bing usage grew up as its quality got up a bit and the Microsoft culture turned a bit more aggressive. I would suspect still a sizable majority of MSFT employees use Google at least as a back up engine when their query doesn’t yield the right results.

If Indians are thrown out of the USA, what would be the condition of the USA afterwards?
<html><body>
<br>what if trump decides to do so one day . ? what will be the consequences ?what would be the reaction in both countries ?
<br>In the short term, somewhat of a negative effect. There might be a bit more employment for the locals that will negate the effect of closure of many companies.
<br>In the long term, US will lose a lot if it kicks out immigration. The majority of great American companies have had first or second generation immigrants as their founders. See examples below.
<br>Here are a few ways the US will lose if it kicks off all Indians:
<br>At this stage, India will be a big gainer if its expat Indians return home. While there will be a short term pain from the loss of some high paying jobs from the locals and medium term pain due to the loss in remittance flow, in the long term India could significantly gain from their global expertise.

Is it civil and does it meet the parliamentary ethics of PM Narendra Modi's comment on Manmohan Singh that he wears a raincoat while taking a bath?
<html><body>
<br>PM Narendra Modi made a derogatory remark in Rajya Sabha today while addressing the house. The Congress MPs rightly staged a walkout from the house.
<br>Normally, the former Prime Ministers and Presidents stay off from harsh language. They had their chance and it is up to their successors. When they break that protocol, they get their honor thrown apart.
<br>Manmohan Singh led a government that was tarred apart by the people a little over a two years ago. He led his party to its worst ever defeat. He led his party through a host of scams and riots. He led his party to plenty of shame.
<br>And this silent guy suddenly wakes up and talks “loot and plunder”. If as an economist or a dignified past leader he stuck to real criticism of demonetization, he would have stood tall. He could have talked about the implementation, he could have pleaded the case of the poor, he could have talked about the need for the 2000 rupee notes and he could have talked about the independence of RBI.
<br>Those kind of criticism would have made even the BJP followers think. Rather, he went way over the line and talked of “loot and plunder”.
<br>When people living in glass houses throw stones at passersby, things become problematic.
<br>Manmohan threw his dignity by allowing himself to be remote controlled by Sonia. He never won Lok Sabha elections and for all his term he sneaked by getting a Rajya Sabha nomination, not even from his home state, but from an unrelated Assam where his party had a lot of strength. While the biggest scams of India happened, he stood quiet. And remarkably he was hardly abused - ridiculed and lampooned but not abused - during all that time. Thus, PM Modi termed it him as wearing a raincoat while taking bath - meaning even never let the water touch even when it was gushing around.
<br>This criticism would not have come had MMS stuck to being an economist and given criticism like an economist. He let himself become a lowly politician reading out what the high command gave and thus seeing himself brought to the level of a lowly politician. Oh, the mighty Karma!
</body></html>
What are your views on the Union Budget of India (2017-18)?
<html><body>
<br>It appears that the government is going on a massive spending spree due to the gains from the demonetization. Do you think this budget will spur employment? Does it allot gains from demonetization in the right channels? What do you think are the lost opportunities?
<br>Yet again, a pretty decent one. More guided by prudence than pomp. By merging the railway budget with the union one and preponing the dates, they have signaled some fundamental reforms. Since India’s financial year starts on April 1, it gives a 2 month window from the budget to get the execution in place. In the past scheme of things, budget was released by end of Feb and the Parliament would take 2 months to debate & approve, with the spending going only by the end of summer. Thus, most ministries would not be even able to utilize the allocations they have been given.
<br>The most important one is that the government has been fiscally prudent, the third budget in a row. Instead of going on a spending spree to get votes, they are improving the long term stability of the system by not letting the deficits go up. Since the government is spending within limits, it is quite possible for the RBI to cut interest rates down now that will put more money with the entrepreneurs and create more jobs. To make sure the senior citizens are not that hit with rate cuts there are also schemes for assured interest rates [8%] for them.
<br>Pushing towards cashless economy gets more teeth and that is a central pillar with which the government plans to increase tax collection while reducing tax rates. The reforms for donations to political parties will also improve transparency.
<br>In keeping up with its promise of a minimal government, the government is doing away with the FIPB [Arun Jaitley did a great thing by abolishing FIPB] that was more hindering foreign investments than promoting it.
<br>In infrastructure, there is a push towards electrifying 100% of the villages by next budget. Budget 2017: 10 measures to boost India's infrastructure. Of course, not all houses in those villages might be connected to the grid by next year, but that would be the next battle. More housing focus is also there this time followed by more spending on railway infrastructure. PM's incentives may bring millions into affordable housing.
<br>There is a heavy push on female welfare development - Spending on women-related schemes up 18% in Budget 2017 - and this will help India’s HDI in the long run.
<br>There are some negatives like not big increases on spending on healthcare, research or education.
<br>Overall, it is like Rahul Dravid playing a test match. There are no fireworks or “DLF Maximums”, but there is a lot of prudence building up for the long term.
</body></html>
How does Donald Trump's ideology compare to Narendra Modi's?
<html><body>
<br>Trump and Modi are poles apart.
<br>First, Trump doesn’t have an ideology. Maybe Pence and Bannon do, but Trump doesn’t. He was a Democrat before opportunistically switching to the GOP. He doesn’t fit into any of the conservative pillars. Mainstream republicans are either openly at war or just gritting their teeth so hard that they have let such a guy to lead their party. And, I don’t think he is smart enough to be even evil.
<br>Modi grew up in conservative ideology and was a seasoned politician. He has never lost an election and has been leading the state of Gujarat for 3 terms. While his quick rise to the top of BJP surprised a lot and he sort of sidelined the mainstream BJP, it is likely that his path of conservatism is a lot more milder than the BJP insiders he sidelined [Advani/Joshi].
<br>Second, Trump has been vindictive and tried to overturn everything Obama did - not just the statutes, but even the statues that Obama replaced at the oval office. In complete contrast, Modi has retained almost all of his predecessors good policies - Aadhar, MGNREGA to the point that the previous party complains that Modi “copied” their policies. Modi was quick to bestow honors on MM Singh as the former got the power. Trump stayed on the abusive track.
<br>Third, Trump has been blasting America’s friends and foes alike. He was quite childish when dealing with the likes of Australia and Mexico [Politicians, diplomats scramble to repair US-Australian alliance after Trump tweets]. In contrast, Modi invited his arch foe, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, for his swearing in ceremony and even paid a surprise visit on his birthday. Modi has been building bridges with outside world, while Trump is destroying.
<br>While some of Modi’s speeches in local rallies in vernacular languages display some anger, for the most part he stuck to positivism. He cultivated his image as a vikas purush - development man. Indians are far more positive about their leader than the Americans are. Modi in fact is growing in popularity [Two Years Later, Modi Remains Hugely Popular In India ]. This is why a nation that is quick to riot has been very calm & peaceful in facing a hard move like the demonetization. While some of India’s filmmakers and fiction writers periodically stage in protests [like during the award returning protest], public itself has been calm.
<br>In contrast, Trump has provoked anger and riots. His campaign trail has stressed more on the negativity [against Mexico, China, Middle East, TPP, ACA] and very little on positivity.
<br>Modi is a great asset to the BJP. Without Modi their future was looking bleak. In contrast, Trump is scary to the old school Republicans. He could make the public completely leery of voting another Republican in a generation.
</body></html>
What is the reason that Indira Gandhi was loved by a lot of people?
<html><body>
<br>Indira Gandhi was an enigma. To use Dickens, hers was India’s best of the times and the worst of the times.
<br>In terms of national defense, hers was incomparable. No other Indian leader stood as strong as her. Many Indians know these incidents below, but don’t appreciate how significant those were in the context of the world events.
<br>In 1967, exactly 5 years after the China war, the PLA tried to do a redo. It looked to invade Sikkim. However, unlike her father, Indira Gandhi gave a fitting reply. In that mini-war - Nathu La and Cho La incidents, India had a crushing victory. Less than a decade later, India took over Sikkim [then a Kingdom] in one of the smoothest territory takeovers in the modern world [even more astonishing than Goa takeover]. Unlike Russia’s Crimea takeover, no drama at all. Smooth as spreading butter.
<br>In 1971, Pakistan tried a war. Against Indira/Sam Manekshaw. Oh the tragedy. If even China could be defeated, what would a poor Pakistan do. Crushed they were. Oh it was brutal. The most brutal defeat any major nation suffered since the World War 2. In a few days, a pompous ally of the superpower US was powdered through an abject surrender. Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.
<br>A meek surrender of Pakistan.
<br>Pakistan was split into two in less than two weeks to create the new nation of Bangladesh. Instead of having an enemy in Bengal region, Indira helped create a friend - a friend India is underestimating to this day. Pakistan permanently lost the status as the world’s largest Muslim country. And a key access to the Indian Ocean/South East Asia. And be in a position to open multiple fronts on India. In the modern world, no other nation lost so much in so short a time. After such a big embarrassment, the Pakistan’s dictator Yahya Khan was disgracefully thrown out within days by the locals.
<br>You don’t mess with Indira Gandhi. Period.
<br>As a parting gift in her last year of life, she outfoxed the Pakistanis and brought in the Siachen glacier to India. Pakistan army didn’t know what hit them in that embarrassment when they tried to buy snow gear from a shop in London where the Indian army usually buys - leading to a tip off of a secret operation of their attempted takeover. Operation Meghdoot.
<br>In 1971, she delivered a crushing blow to the newly flung Naxal movement - Operation Steeplechase - and it took a long time for the movement to recover from that blow.
<br>In 1974, India tested its first nuclear bomb and took the world by surprise. Not as grand as the 1998 announcement by Vajpayee, but it was a key event to make India nuclear and at ease against her outside threats. 'Smiling Buddha' had caught US off-guard in 1974.
<br>It is very important to note the successes of the military leadership, such as Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw in such victories above. Also, while talking about her victories, it would also be important to discuss the key ways she weakened India.
<br>The above events caused a hatred for her and weakened her party. Her shortcuts, realpolitik and a “ends justify the means” attitude removed India’s moral standing in the global arena and brought in huge side effects. For the only time in our history, India got enmity of US and other western powers.
<br>While her economic policies significantly impoverished India, she also helped some of the key programs in food security. Green Revolution in India and Operation Flood. Both of these, we should note the key involvement of the scientists here, helped cut down famines and hunger significantly.
<br>Indira put an end to payments to royals and that marked the last part of India’s complete integration of all the princely states. These made her quite popular. Her amendment to the Constitution in 1967 guarantee English a status comparable to that of Hindi and put an end to the anti-Hindi agitations of the South. She also gave statehood to most of northeast that were previously just hanging with random territory distinctions.
<br>Apart from political reasons, Indira is also liked for a few other reasons.
</body></html>
Is it wrong if I am a pro-Hindutva Indian?
<html><body>
<br>It all depends on what you mean by pro-Hindutva.
<br>If it means the celebration of the ideals of Vedas, upanishads, Gita, Thirukkural, the Ramayana, Mahabharata and other great works of Hinduism, it is great. If it means appreciating the temples, visiting them and restoring them, it is great. If it means exploring the spirituality in all the great means we have available - yoga, dhyana etc that is great.
<br>It is also great to stand against the destruction of temples & religious symbols out of hate and bigotry. It is great to stand against unfairness.
<br>It is all great when it is the spiritual form where you are exploring your inner self. And Hinduism is the perfect major religion for exploring your inner self without a lot of dogma and prophet sayings. By all means feel free to flaunt your spirituality and your understanding of great literature.
<br>When religion becomes less spiritual and more political, things start getting problematic. I’m troubled by some of Savarkar’s fans - as they see Hinduism’s glory less through the prism of theism & spirituality, but more through the prism of politics.
<br>When Hindutva dictates which gender can visit a particular temple especially with no authority in Vedas and ancient scriptures, things start getting problematic.
<br>When Hindutva dictates which sport is to be banned or not, it becomes problematic.
<br>When Hindutva dictates who can live in a particular land and who cannot, it becomes problematic.
<br>In general, religion and politics corrupt each other when brought into contact. While it is perfectly fine for our leaders to give gifts of Ramayana and other Indian works, we should also keep out of driving an impression of a unitary culture.
<br>Of the major religions, Hinduism was the only to evolve for thousands of years. Other religions had prophets whose words are regarded as true always. In Hinduism’s case truth is something that is constantly explored. That also means process towards truth changes. Lord Krishna threw out many of the ancient practices that the Gopalas practiced as he lifted the mount Govardhana. Adi Sankaracharya threw out many of the subsequent practices as he exhorted the grammarians of Varanasi [Bhaja Govindam Moodamathe] and banned animal sacrifice from major temples. And our subsequent gurus reformed even more practices.
<br>This process of constant evolution of religious ideas while in the pursuit of truth is being the true Hindu. That flexibility and growth is the essence of Hinduism. If you try to add inflexibility and stick on to outdated ideas, you are not a Hindu. You are no way inheriting the principle of Upanishads that center on the principle of questioning and exploration.
<br>If being pro-Hindutva means crushing the caste discrimination and upholding the essence of Vedanta, that is awesome. If being pro-Hindutva means crushing other people’s religious sites and upholding some outdated ideas stuck in the middle, then it is awful.

Why have the Chinese not attacked India since the Sino-Indian war of 1962?
<html><body>
<br>China’s 1962 victory was a sheer element of surprise. India was hoping that its relationship with US & USSR would ward off a China attack. And they were mostly right.
<br>However, on October 16 1962, US and USSR were involved in an extremely dangerous standoff - Cuban Missile Crisis that threatened to wipe out the entire humanity in a nuclear destruction.
<br>As the globe was focused in that horror, 4 days later on October 20, China attacked India. Nobody in the world had the time or energy to focus or intervene in that.
<br>As a member of the Communist group, Mao had the knowledge of the situation in Cuba far before Indians did. He predicted this massive showdown and prepared his troops for that.
<br>The element of surprise is a great advantage and especially as the cold weather set in, the Indian soldiers of the plains were at clear disadvantage in the high peaks of the Himalayas. The frost-bites and cold weather related deaths were a lot as India didn’t then have a lot of expertise in fighting wars in cold battlefields. Chinese on the other were more used to the cold weather.
<br>However, the Chinese were clever not to push the advantage too far and ended the operation in weeks. Especially they didn’t try to cross into the plains of Assam and had they did they might have had serious loss from India’s Air Force operating from Kolkata. And they pulled off from pretty much all of Arunachal Pradesh. Apart from India’s airforce threat, counterattack from a woken up army and snow setting in the Himalayas, Chinese were forced to pull back due to an American threat of a nuclear war.

<br>Since then, Indians were more careful not to trust just the superpower collaboration and built a stronger surveillance & border protection. That has cut out of the element of surprise and there were no such events like the Cuban missile crisis since then. Indians also have the advantage of geography - while the Chinese have to travel a lot and cross huge mountains to get to the border, the borders are not far from India’s major cities and the troops can be quickly mobilized to get to the border. The growth of India’s navy with the possession of nuclear triad also enables it a significant counterattack capability.
<br>Also, China got what it wanted - to teach India a lesson & wound her pride. There was less incentive for them to move more & get into expensive wars without a purpose.
<br>EDIT: As people noted in the comments, we should note the Nathu La and Cho La incidents - a mini-war in 1967 where China tried to little bit replicate what they did 1962, but this time to a well prepared India. India had a crushing victory and within a decade took over the territory of Sikkim that China still disputes.

Would Balaji Vishwanathan contest elections if given a ticket by BJP?
<html><body>
<br>No. Political power is analogous to electrical power. You see the big transmission lines above you transferring massive amounts of energy at thousands of volts. You might be tempted by all that energy and could try to directly connect your electrical appliances. The resulting flow of energy from that high power transmission line would cause a complete destruction of all your valuable properties and maybe even your life. And everyone who touches you also will be electrocuted.
<br>That is what happens to people who underestimate the power of power. Prematurely entering politics is the best way to ruin everything you have built.
<br>To harness that massive amount of power, you need transformers [no not the one with Megan Fox], excellent insulation, a lot of fuses and a whole range of systems to isolate and manage power to make sure only your electric stove burns, but not you. I don’t have any such systems and it would be futile for me to even imagine politics now.

What will happen if Tamil Nadu gets separated from India now?
<html><body>
<br>During the protests for jallikattu in recent days, some people have started to raise their voices against ‘TN being a part of India’ due to the lack of response from the central government and also mentioning many past issues like kavery river issue,etc. What would happen if this happens really?
<br>If it gets separated, O. Paneerselvam will become the Prime Minister of the new nation and represent the new country in United Nations and other bodies. Ms. Sasikala could become the President. The two can tour the world interacting with world leaders and charm the globe to get new treaties and trade pacts while dancing for the national anthem of “Takkaru Takkaru”. Imagine that delight in the face of patriotic Tamils.
<br>Bull will be the national animal and “#BanPETA and #SaveJallikattu” will be national motto. Jayalalitha would be the “Mother of the Nation” and might be in all the currency notes to be printed from Sivakasi. The Dravidian parties can then take their things on a global scale. The new capital will switch between Mannargudi and Chennai every 5 years. Sometimes a Parliament building will be constructed and then later used as a hospital.
<br>The new nation would have to negotiate a water treaty with India and the latter might not agree on anything. Maybe after decades World Bank would negotiate a water sharing treaty like it did between India and Pakistan. In such a case, half or more of Cauvery will remain in India. Tamil Nadu right now gets more than half of the river Cauvery and still if it is not sufficient imagine an internationally negotiated treaty that reduces its share. Even that much will not be available from Krishna, Mullaperiyar and other water sources. Starvation and lower agricultural productivity.
<br>Oh, don’t worry we have the leaders to manage this - I’m sure Paneerselvam with his alternatives like Thirumavalavan, Stalin and other can take on such challenges. If needed Mr. Alagiri can always display his diplomatic and organizational skills. They can also be aided by people drawing stuff on chart paper and bring to the beach. If enough fun is not had, we can ask Mr. Seeman to bring in a dead Sri Lankan leader’s picture.
<br>The new nation has to build an army from scratch. There are only a few Tamils in the army and even some of those might not migrate to the new nation. That means a new army and new set of training that will take decades to mature. Oh, let’s not worry. If we can do social media forwards we can also fight in the battlefields. Can’t we?
<br>Sri Lankan navy will continue to shoot the fishermen deliberately fishing in their territory and now that the new Tamil nation would not even have a capable navy for a long time, there would not be any big response. Once the Tamil nation develops a good navy after a long time, we can have fun wars with Sri Lanka. For once Tamil Nadu can feel what it is like to be at the border and fight constant wars. Since Tamil Nadu will be comparable in size to Sri Lanka, the latter would not have much fear.
<br>The new nation would not have the benefit of cities like Bangalore and Mumbai and have to accomodate the returning expats from rest of India - in its only metropolis of Chennai. And no central government institution for anything - remove those IIT, IIM, NIT and other institutions - our state government is capable of running world class institutions.
<br>The new nation can take out Hindi and English too. Oh, the languages of darn corporates. Just like Bangladesh, we can have everything in our native language. We also know the great things that happen when people try to construct a nation around a particular language, religion etc. See the gory history of nation states. We will all resign our jobs and live the life of agriculture. So much money to be made in farming that can sustain all of us 75 million people.
<br>Oh the favorable freight arrangement that Tamil Nadu got that ensures minerals from Bihar and other regions are given at as much price as the mineral producing states. Oh that is gone too. Chennai’s industrial output is going to be hampered.
<br>And we didn’t even get to India’s behavior and reaction after an hostile exit from it. India’s tiny little military is the world’s fourth largest and even after Tamil Nadu’s exit it might retain that ranking. Good luck trying to spend a lot of your GDP in a staring match with it.
<br>With unity, we can all scale great heights as Indians. Or we can split apart and suck our thumbs. This is true for every state in the union - no state in the country is special enough to survive as a great nation outside. Every state benefits by being in the union. Whether you are a Tamilian or Punjabi or Assamese or Kashmiri, your speciality will only be as long as you stay in India. You can fully claim the history of the subcontinent, its great wonders, diversity, struggles and empires. Outside that all of these will be mere banana republics no more important than Syria or Nicaragua - one among the 200 odd nations that people might not even know until there is a chaos.

If Balaji Vishwanathan builds a time machine, which events in history would he like to visit?
<html><body>
<br>I will first head to April 19, 1975 and watch India’s first satellite - Aryabhata launching from Russia. One small satellite, one big milestone for a billion people. On the way I might stop on July 25, 1991 to see Manmohan herald India’s liberalization and head to 1989 to see the wall in Berlin collapse while the famous Tank Man in Beijing walked boldly in front of the tanks. Small steps in ending the socialism of post-World War.
<br>I would watch Apollo 11 land on the moon on July 20, 1969 and share the dreams of the humanity that would have been dreaming of interplanetary travel in a short time with the pace of achievements till then.
<br>After that I will head straight to Jan 30, 1948 and get the last glimpse of Mahatma Gandhi and watch India get freedom on August 15, 1947. Then get to the 6th June 1944 for Normandy landings to see how the World War decisively turned. Two years before then, I would get a glimpse of the ruthless efficiency of the Wehrmacht in Germany.
<br>I would look to find the great sparks that occurred to Einstein, Newton, Galileo, Aryabhata, da Vinci, Bhaskara, Aristotle and others. I would try to march along with the great armies of Alexander, Ashoka, Genghis Khan, Qin Shi Huang, Raja Raja, Darius and others.
<br>I would like to look closer into the wicked dreams of the great viziers and nobles such as Bagoas that brought down the great empires. I would stand aside great poets such as Shakespeare, Kalidasa, Kamban and others as they penned their poems.
<br>I would spend happy times in the streets of the Gupta empire and the Chola empire, besides the capitals of Constantine and Kublai Khan. I will wonder the adventures in Mali and the great rituals of Mayas. I will stand in awe as the great Angkor Wat was getting built. I would watch how Ashoka erected his pillars and how Krishnadevaraya and Rajendra Chola built their temples.
<br>I will run the time machine so much in space and time, that it would quickly run out of fuel.
<br>Finally, I would land in the Indus Valley Civilization circa 2000 BCE and truly try to understand who these people were and what their life looked like. I would probably not like to leave from there - even though I might miss some of the things like modern medicine. It is where my heart belongs.

Why hasn't Balaji Viswanathan written any views on jallikattu yet?
<html><body>
<br>I’m not happy with such a sport and I’m dismayed by the turn of the events on both sides. However, I can sort of live with such a sport as there are much bigger animal cruelty battles to be fought. Since people feel so strongly, it is probably unwise to ban now and let it run with restrictions. Someday we can have a more rigorous debate on this when the passions cool.
<br>The narrative about the Jallikattu protests have been that there is no room for two opinions in Tamil Nadu right now. People’s passions and angers are whipped up. Even superstars like Rajnikanth couldn’t refrain from giving their “approval”. You cannot stay silent, but give an opinion, you cannot give any opinion but only positive and you cannot give it anytime but now. Viva la democracia!
<br>A lot of the anger and outbursts in Tamil Nadu stem from the sudden demise of Jayalalitha. In her regime such protests would not have been done. As the state is run headless, people are venting a frustration on a lot of things.
<br>There were also plenty of other claims raised in this issue, for which there are no satisfactory answers.
<br>Ultimately, it is not a question of protecting specific breeds or getting a specific milk. But, more of protecting a cultural tradition. For a lot of present issues, we have been giving the defense of tradition. Whether it is the women entry into Haji Ali and Sabarimala or issue of triple talaq, the traditionalists have been fighting the courts using ancient logic. But, I personally don’t accept such a defense of tradition in any of these cases. Traditions are nice as long as they don’t violate basic principles [Constitution of India].
<br>We can always alter traditions a bit. The Sangam era Tamils loved their bulls and protected them. Maybe that is the real tradition and we can innovate an alternative mechanism to show the love and protect the diversity. Maybe our modern men can use other sports like football to show their valor and not be forced into excessive danger to score. If we can organize such big crowds, can we also provide alternative ways to fund these precious bulls without goring ourselves and the bulls?
<br>And turn on the news now. Watch what the various vested interests are doing in the pretext of people protest. Should we become a pawn in a big powerplay? If you really care about the bulls and biodiversity, you can easily find a middle ground with animal lovers and animal rights groups.
<br>You have got the ordinance you wanted. It is time to come back to normal.

Why do just eight individuals, all men, own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's population?
<html><body>
<br>Read the link provided below and answer accodingly.
<br>'Obscene': 8 Men Own Half The World's Wealth, Says Oxfam - NDTV
<br>Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt [both men] own more Olympic medals than 99.99% of the world.
<br>While I see merit in having everyone assured a basic standard of living and letting no one go hungry/cold/roofless, I find it ridiculous to believe wealth should be equally spread.
<br>Just like in swimming and athletics, the ability to produce innovation and build wealth is not equally distributed across all humanity. Just like Phelps and Bolt have some special abilities to perform extraordinary movements, Gates, Bezos, Buffett, Bloomberg and others have some extraordinary abilities to produce innovation and build businesses.
<br>There are so many countries in the world that don’t have such a self-made billionaire without the government “gifting” off a big chunk of their oil & other assets. Does that mean they have better equality and standard of living than the United States?
<br>Are there other social factors that Gates was a beneficiary of? Did his social systems help him rise up? Of course, same it did with Phelps and others. Phelps could not have become such a special swimmer in the developing world with scant facilities. That doesn’t mean he has to gift his medals to the society. It is a symbiotic relationship - extremely talented ones and a creative society they live in help each other.
<br>In fact, looking at the 8 people at the top should restore faith in humanity. They are not royals nor having great hereditary wealth. Almost all of them built from scratch. They were all stories of entrepreneurship. All of them were first generation entrepreneurs [at that scale].
<br>While Buffett and Slim were beneficiaries of business minded parents, the others were stories of great struggle of people with no business background building first generation enterprises. Some were sons of book keepers, railway workers, lawyers and dentists. Others like Bezos and Ellison [like Jobs] endured tumultuous childhood due to unprepared/unqualified biological parents.
<br>They all depict human struggle and the will to overpower them. A large chunk of these guys are great philanthropists who gave away far, far more wealth than their critics had seconds in their life.
<br>In short, there is nothing obscene or scary or wrong about it. Just like in the case of Phelps and Bolt, we get to marvel some stupendous human talent at work.

What do you think on Andhra CM's decision of rewarding INR 100 crore to anyone from Andhra who wins Nobel prize?
<html><body>
<br>Is this a good decision?
<br>Not very useful. Nobel Prize is already a very attractive prize and can make a scientist reasonably rich. It is not like a lot of successful scientists are not pursuing the Nobel because the cash from the prize is low.
<br>We Indians shower gold on those who succeed - say the bronze & silver medalists at the Rio Olympics. People go on a stampede to gift to these winners. The 100 crore AP government gift is just that.
<br>Pouring millions on Sakshi or Sindhu is not going to fill India with medals just as pouring millions on a Nobel laureate will not take our research to heights. Our problems - whether it be in sports or research is more fundamental and much more at the ground. We should rather use those millions to have the talent search for the next Sindhu or CV Raman and grooming those potential candidates over a long period of time.
<br>A Nobel laureate is created after 30+ years of effort. The government has to more worry about how they can make sure the life of those top scientists are less miserable and that depends more on access to resources. My friends who were doing Phd in IISc Physics departments spent a very long time to finish their Phd - because they could not get basic materials on time. If the government puts effort on those things, those scientists would finish their research on time, accelerate and have a shot at the big things.
<br>While it is laudable that CB Naidu is creating more awareness for the problem, I don’t think this move will do any good. It is not like India’s top scientists will suddenly start working extra hard, because there is extra prize money. Those who really succeed are already self-motivated and they will pursue that truth anyway.

Why are Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi praising each other?
<html><body>
<br>Post note ban, Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar are all praise for each other - Times of India. Prakash Parv: PM Modi, Nitish Praise Each Other at Patna Event. Two were speaking at the 350th Prakash Parv at Patna. Why would they praise each other when their parties are in opposition in State and Centre?
<br>I have always felt that Nitish Kumar is too much of a sane guy to work with Lalu Prasad Yadav, Mulayam Singh, Rahul Gandhi and others who formed that “grand alliance”. For most of his adult life he was fighting those forces. He and his mentor George Fernandes broke away from the Janata Dal to form the Samata Party in 1994 due to the rampant casteism therein.
<br>His primary career was built in collaboration with the BJP. He was the Union Minister for Railways under Vajpayee and brought about reforms like online booking. After taking responsibility for an accident he became the minister of Agriculture. And the first time he became a Chief Minister of Bihar was in collaboration with the BJP.
<br>After 18 years of allying with the BJP, Nitish broke away before the 2014 general elections - not out of ideological or economic reasons, but due to an ego clash with Modi. Nitish probably thought he could be a Prime Minister candidate of the NDA, until Modi just blazed through.
<br>In the couple of years since then, it is possible that he truly realizes why Modi became the head of the coalition and also realizes that his chances of becoming a PM is remote even under the present arrangement. Nitish is pragmatic and knows what horse to bet on.
<br>In short, Nitish has spent most of his life hating the guys he is currently working with. I would not be very surprised if Nitish returns to the NDA fold. Might not happen that soon and he might want to keep the cards closed until the UP elections. If BJP fails miserably there, he might pragmatically choose to stay put. However, if BJP has a good show, Nitish might reconsider his present arrangement of being in room with guys he hates so much.

Why can't India give Kashmir to Kashmiris or Pakistan?
<html><body>
<br>Is India simply interested in the land and not the people of Kashmir?
<br>Let’s say India decides to give up Jammu & Kashmir. To whom will it give?
<br>To the Sunnis of valley, Shias of Kargil & Budgam, Gujjar/Pahari Muslims of Rajouri, Doda & Poonch, Hindus of Jammu region or Buddhists of Ladakh?
<br>To the people who have not been following the ethnic clashes around the world, the answer would be simple. Give it to the Muslims - who make a majority. Of course, when India was divided was it not divided based on religion, they might ask.
<br>Islam is not an ethnicity. If religion is a sole basis of division, why did Pakistan undergo a further partition to form Bangladesh? Why is the Shia-Sunni sectarian clashes ripping apart Pakistan now? Why are they destroying each other’s holy places? And if religion is the sole attribute of ethnicity, why are Syria, Yemen and elsewhere in Middle East burning now?
<br>Like India itself, Jammu & Kashmir is a melting pot of ethnicities - built over centuries of tolerance and acceptance.
<br>Let’s look at the ethnic map of the state.
<br>Calling the Pro-Pakistan Kashmiri bluff
<br>Here are the following major groups of Kashmir:
<br>There used to be an 8th group. In 1947, 8% of Kashmir valley were Kashmiri pandits. Now, it is a near 0. I know so many of them and all of them have just run away from their homes. It is just a starting point. Next up is the what is left of the Ahmadis [Kashmir's grand cleric asks govt to declare Ahmadis non-Muslims] and Shias: Are Kashmiri Shias The Next Pandits? And up next will be tribal Sunnis [Pahari/Gujjars] who mostly follow the Sufi tradition.
<br>And we didn’t get into what happens to the Buddhists of Ladakh or Hindus of Jammu.
<br>In short, we would have a big sized Syrian violence in our hands - with multiple ethnicities getting ripped apart and millions sent as refugees.
<br>[As a side note, this is the same issue India faces in the north east - there is a massive mosaic of ethnicities there. For instance, if you give into a Nagalim, what happens to the Kukis and Meiteis of Manipur.]
<br>While the stone throwing and violence gets national attention, national readers don’t realize that majority come from a couple of districts - Anantnag, Shopian, Kulgam and Kupwara. Even in the valley, districts of Baramulla, Ganderbal and Budgam are fairly quiet.
<br>Should we give up the whole state due to a vocal minority of stone throwers? What happens to the silent majority - the melting pot of ethnicities there? Should we replace the so called Indian hegemony with Sunni-valley hegemony? Should we leave the region to chaos like in Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan? If you think pellet guns are horrible, wait for real machine guns and bombs like in Middle East.
<br>And which do you think is better positioned to handle enormous diversity - Pakistan, an independent Kashmir or India? Which has a better track record?
<br>Remember, the state voted in a “nationalist” party in a BJP coalition with a far higher voter turnout than almost any state election. Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 2014. And India was the one that was pushing for a plebiscite for a long time and even pushed the UN for it [United Nations Security Council Resolution 47]. Why would India do that if it was not confident of winning a majority of the people in the state?
<br>As the former chief of army staff Gen. Roychowdhury said India could conduct a plebiscite even now [Why this is an opportune moment for India to call for a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir] but the issue is all sorts of ramifications from it - including the violence and bloodshed that would precede in getting people vote on the right lines.
<br>EDIT: Some people compared Kashmir situation to colonial India. It is a fairly old argument that doesn’t hold much water. Ignoring the fact that India is not a colonial power nor Kashmir is a colony, the argument fails for the following reasons:
<br>What is the equivalent of Congress movement in Kashmir? Who is the equivalent of Gandhi and Nehru who can speak for all Jammu & Kashmiris - the Sunnis, Shias, Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists of the state? If you truly build such a mature, egalitarian movement that can responsibly take over the state, many Indians will be open to the idea of an independent Kashmir. However, it doesn’t even look remotely like one.

Has anyone benefited tangibly from answering on Quora?
<html><body>
<br>I’m probably one of the biggest beneficiaries. It got me to connect with India like nothing before. Now, I feel a bonding/attachment with most states of India through thousands of people on Quora. I could travel to almost any city in India and have a quick meetup there and connect with people in that city. I feel as though every city is my city and feel at home.
<br>I travel almost every week [majority of which are sponsored] and have already traveled the ends of India. I have given talks with plenty of top institutions in the country sharing stage with some of the real celebrities. I have dozens of my articles published in top media outlets like TIME, Newsweek, Forbes, Fortune etc.
<br>I have made plenty of friendships. I love to talk to so many budding students and mentor them whatever little way possible. It has made me feel far younger than as I hang out mostly with college students these days. And I have hired every full time employee at my startup [8 of them now] through Quora.
<br>In my previous company, plenty of interns in the company came through looking at my Quora profile. In the past, I have had some top investors meetings, such as the one with Paul Graham for YCombinator selection through Quora activity. While in the valley, I was invited for a few events like Saastr through my Quora activity.
<br>I have published a book collecting some of my answers and many bought the book through Amazon [have done zero marketing for it so far — probably will do it for the next edition]. I have conducted classes and bootcamps through Quora.
<br>In short, I have written a book through Quora, conducted classes through Quora, mentored students through Quora, hired through Quora and stretch Quora’s powers as much as possible. And I have not even scratched the surface on truly what is possible with the network.
<br>I have not gone to a single Quora Top Writer meetup [due to scheduling conflicts] and if I had done that probably even more connections and benefits could have accrued.
<br>Quora is my happy place and I’m glad I joined here.

Autorickshaw drivers are facing losses due to Uber and Ola. Is this fair?
<html><body>
<br>It is not just fair, it is amazing. If the autorickshaw drivers truly provided customer service they would not be at a loss. They monopolized the routes and often treated the customers like shit. And their attitude really hampered movement in India.
<br>I have lived in most major cities in India and they all had poor transportation. In Mumbai/Pune, you cannot even easily get an autorickshaw and the guys behave as though they are the admissions committee at Harvard. In Chennai, you can easily get an auto, but they will rip you off. In Bangalore, you will both be harder to find and quick to rip. In Delhi, you hope to stay safe.
<br>Ridesharing services help address the severe mobility problem we face in India. Without them we would not be able to do our work as efficiently [instead spending more time begging those arrogant guys and reaching offices late] and that means loss of GDP to the nation.
<br>Ola/Uber truly helps cut regional/linguistic barriers in the country. Imagine a non-Tamilian coming to Chennai. The auto drivers would eat them alive. Their experience with bad autodrivers often made outsiders hate the city. Now, you just open your familiar pan-India app get a taxi and down to your destination with zero drama and haggling. Rideshare services truly help integrate India.
<br>It also helps tourism as foreign tourists can also navigate our cities much more easily with very familiar tools.
<br>Ridesharing services makes our resources very efficient. How often do you see Ola/Uber drivers sit idle with their cars? How often do you see auto drivers chatting idly with empty autorickshaws?
<br>Ridesharing services provide a predictable income and can truly enable a worker to enter the middle class [many cab drivers make Rs. 25000 and more per month]. Most autorickshaw drivers on the other hand cannot enter the middle class with their volumes and incomes.
<br>Ola/Uber is also quite safe, especially for women. If a woman gets harassed in Ola/Uber it becomes a national news as it is quite rare. On the other hand, harassment on an autorickshaw it is a usual thing and moved to inner pages. If women can travel outside much more and stay safer India’s productivity and welfare go up.
<br>Ridesharing services are amazing for the country - it enables better movement, better tourism, better efficiency, better safety and better economic mobility. As for the autorickshaw drivers, the ones who are truly smart and not hiding behind the union can get great opportunities even now.

Is Andhra Pradesh government doing right thing building a capital city from scratch rather than choosing Vizag?
<html><body>
<br>Yes. CBN is doing the right thing in building a city. Across the world, countries climbed the ladders of prosperity through urbanization. In fact, the Sanskrit word Nagarik [citizen] is directly from the word Nagar [an urban center]. There is no prosperity without a lot of new cities.
<br>Our Indus Valley greatness was built on cities and so did the great times since then [like the Gupta dynasty]. As the Gangetic valley lost its urban centers in the past few centuries, so did the economic prosperity of the region.
<br>Americans built hundreds of new cities in the 19th century as they climbed to greatness. Even in contemporary India, the states with greater prosperity have more number of cities. Maharashtra has Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nagpur and Nashik. Tamil Nadu has Chennai, Coimbatore, Trichi and Madurai. Neither have enough but more than Andhra Pradesh that has just two Tier-2 cities [Vizag and Vijayawada] and nothing else big. Surely, AP needs plenty of new cities.
<br>Rather than building haphazardly on top of existing cities, Indian states have to build a dozen cities each from scratch. These can be planned and efficient. This would reduce the stress on existing cities and also make homes affordable & economic prosperity reachable for all.
<br>In fact, this is one reason I support creating new states. Because, it creates an excuse for building new capitals and urban centers. I recently flew into the Ranchi airport and I was quite impressed. If Jharkhand were still a part of Bihar, there would have been no capital there and no major infrastructure either.
<br>We need a lot of new cities and a lot of wonderful capital cities too. We have barely gotten started.

Do you think Taare Zameen Par and Dangal are contradicting each other in terms of standards for good parenting?
<html><body>
<br>I’m big fan of both these Aamir Khan movies. Taare Zameen Par is a movie about parenting and teaching children. It has a certain message. Dangal is a biopic - real life story of a sporting hero - and it is less about a message & more about the rise of a star.
<br>In TZP, the parents didn’t understand the child and didn’t pay attention to his abilities. It is what we call “lazy parenting”. Parents impose something on their children just because they are too lazy to think about their future.
<br>In Dangal, the father paid attention to his daughter’s abilities. He didn’t try to raise them as a wrestler from the get go, but adapted to it based on their strengths. And he fought against the stereotypes [of what a girl should do and when she should get married], while in TZP the parents were those stereotypes.
<br>Of course, Mahavir was controversial too - especially the part about cutting their hair that short could be construed as a mild child abuse. While in the movie they diluted some of his harsh parenting tactics, from the news reports it looks like the real Phogat was quite strict [Uncle Mahavir was 10 times stricter than Aamir in Dangal].
<br>Herein lies the conundrum. To raise a sporting star, you have to be shaping their future way before they can think independently. Imagine trying to train a gymnast. The training would start before the kid even could learn to speak. You cannot wait for them to grow a free will to start sports training. That would be too late.
<br>And raising a sports star also means putting enormous physical stress on their body. How else will their strength go up? Thus, the bar on child abuse should be a bit higher in these cases as long as the parent has the right intent. Of course, if he is breaking their bones he should be out of the parenting game.
<br>In summary, both the movies stress on paying enough attention to the kids and their abilities. However, they differ on how much to push. TZP advocates an approach that is more easy - as the child is trying to be an artist - while Dangal is more a stringent/disciplinarian approach.
<br>And I love we can have such conversation about our movies rather than talking about their item songs, how stupid & cliched the plot lines are etc.

What is your opinion about the name of Saif and Kareena's baby Taimur?
<html><body>
<br>About a decade ago, a couple in Germany tried to name their child “Osama bin Laden”. There was no Twitter drama then, no media hustle and no celebrities talking elaborately on their defense. The government put up a middle finger and simply said you cannot have an offensive name. [Couple try to name baby bin Laden].
<br>In developed countries such as Norway, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, New Zealand and Japan, there are laws on what names parents can keep. These 11 countries are banning certain baby names because parents can't be trusted. This is to prevent parents from keeping stupid names and badly impacting their children’s future. [Names banned around the world]
<br>Keeping a horrible name is effectively child abuse. You are imposing your politics on a little child and exposing him/her to unnecessary bullying and taunting. They could potentially lose jobs and friends in the future. Since it is counted as child abuse, the society has a say in it. Not just the parent’s choice. If the parents try to name after a notorious plunderer, the society has a duty to intervene. [To understand what Timur did to Delhi, start from here: A History of India]
<br>A while ago a woman was jailed in Norway for keeping a random name, just because she was obsessed about bridges. Mother Jailed For Violating Norway's Strict Name Law. Norway might be extreme in these things, but the underlying principle is understandable - don’t put your children to an unfair disadvantage deliberately.
<br>A friend of mine was named Ravanan. His father was from a fringe group and wanted that name. Imagine what that poor boy had to face if he travels in north India. Eventually, the father’s extremism went away and I believe they all had a name change with gazette notification. Another schoolmate of mine was named Stalin. It might not look odd in Chennai, but imagine what happens when he gets to any western country. Unnecessary visa delays and even job refusals can happen.
<br>Same in the case of Nathuram Godse, Taimur, Hitler, Kumbakarnan or Himmler, Osama etc. We have a Meghalayan politician named Adolf Lu Hitler Marak. The state also has a Frankenstein: Hitler, Frankenstein Compete in Indian Local Elections
<br>Not just terrible characters, the parents also name children with cruel stuff. Like naming a baby girl Nakushi [unwanted] - 285 Indian girls shed 'unwanted' names - you will be in tears to hear the story of these girls.
<br>In India, our government doesn’t care about naming as we don’t care about child welfare in general. Our laws are not kept up to pace on parenting. Parents think of children as their property and do whatever they want. Think of all the stupid ways our celebrities are defending the parents here - as though the society has no responsibility for that child.
<br>Someone has to file a PIL in the Supreme Court on this and bring about a landmark case in the way in which parents can treat their children. The courts are much more aggressive on these things. Also by the way, it is terrible to talk ill of these victims and the people who offended the poor child of Kareena Kapoor & Saif Ali Khan has to be ashamed of themselves. The child cannot choose his parents.
<br>EDIT: What kind of names have to be banned:

Has Modi's demonetization plan begun to back-fire?
<html><body>
<br>No. As of Dec 28, it does not look so. The government is probably doing better than it originally planned.
<br>Very few countries would have been able to pull off this massive a project with little hiccups [the few rule flip flops that happened]. Other demonetization ventures either had to be pulled off [like in Venezuela] or have been quite small [like what happened in 1978].
<br>The government tried to bite something impossibly gargantuan - taking 87% of the currency off in a mere 50 days in a heavily cash centric economy. And it was directly impacting its core voting constituency - small traders. Surely the BJP leaders must have been very, very nervous 7 weeks ago. It no longer looks that scary. In fact, it got off a whole Parliament session fairly easy given the chaos within the opposition with statements like army coup, earthquake and massive loot, distracting a more logical criticism.
<br>RBI can also now breathe easy that it no longer has to tweak or change any rule now that Dec 30 is passing and as the 500 rupee notes get out more in the next couple of weeks, there might be normalcy even in the smaller towns and villages by January.
<br>With the storm passed, it is time to fix the after-effects and destruction. There are a sizable portion of people who will struggle to transition. I guess the government should focus now on:

What is Balaji Viswanathan's view on Rs. 3600 Crore Shivaji Statue being built in Mumbai?
<html><body>
<br>I’m quite conflicted and divided on this issue. This is one reason why I have not talked about it so far. Even now I’m not fully decided as I don’t know the break up of how the 3600 crores is going to be spent [someone has to file an RTI to get that info]. How much is going to be spent on the statue itself [that I don’t find it as useful a spending] and how much is to be spent on surrounding infrastructure [museum, aquarium, boat jetties etc all of which is productive] will decide which way I shift.
<br>As a principle I’m against building a lot of new monuments. Whether it is the Sardar’s statue of unity or Ambedkar’s park, Thiruvalluvar’s statue in Kanyakumari or any one of the massive god statues we are erecting these days. I like all of these heroes, but it would be mind boggling if every community starts to spend 1000s of crores on their heroes.
<br>We have enough of great heroes in this country - besides the ones in question we have Ashoka, Raja Raja, Adi Sankara, Pulakesin, Chanakya, Aryabhatta, Buddha, Akbar, Vivekananda, Chandra Gupta[s], Samudragupta, Gandhi, Guru Nanak, Ved Vyasa, Tagore.. - are we going to build such massive memorials to all of them? How about their next in line? What if we get into that race - where we start building higher and higher memorials like what happened in the myth of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To...?
<br>People often bring up the example of pyramids to compare with this. The building of pyramids and other great statues often show how unequal the Egyptian society was at that time. I’m more in love with the Indus Valley Civilization - we don’t have any evidence of their palaces or big statues or monuments. What we are left are their amazing drainage systems, roads, ports and great baths.
<br>In the Vedic civilization, we once again don’t see any evidence of major structures. They rather produced stupendous works of art and literature. Same is true of the early Tamil civilization of the Sangas - we know their great works of literature, but nothing about their buildings. With Ashoka, we know of his roads and pillars to remind people of laws. But, we don’t know of his memorials or statues. We don’t even have any big ancient statue of the character we love the most - Rama.
<br>In some sense, building great monuments or statues is unIndian. It is not something our ancient civilization was known of. It is more of Egyptian and Greek culture. With their influence we started building a few huge structures in the latter half of our history.
<br>Even after that, only a very few Indian emperors went on a memorial building spree. Think of Shah Jahan. His memorials were nice, but he was anything but nice. He was a fairly brutal guy and far worse than his grandfather - the latter didn’t build as many monuments. In general, history has been that - bigger the monument, worse the emperor.
<br>I’m still trying to find an example of a good leader in Indian history who spent a lot of effort in building memorials & monuments. Many built usable structures such as temples and forts, but how many built large statues & structures in memory of someone?
<br>Even with temples there are limits. The Cholas, while not building memorials, built great temples. But, that was in their last stages. They didn’t last long after completing the great many temples around Thanjavur. Maybe they were exhausted after spending so much time and money and thus could not face the onslaught of the Pandians [the Pandians didn’t build anything great - but were far long lasting].
<br>Oh and by the way, how many memorials did Shivaji Maharaj construct? Did he spend more time on strengthening his forts & providing welfare to his people or was his life spent more on building great monuments?
<br>It is not a question of whether Shivaji deserves a memorial, but whether memorials are even necessary. I do understand some of the positives of such a monument:
<br>However, it could also be argued that we have far high number of existing memorials, temples and forts that we can dust up and put on tourist map without as much spending. We just need to provide good toilets, roads and other basic infrastructure around them.
<br>We need to understand how much of the budget goes to these surrounding infrastructure and how much goes to the statue itself. If over 75% goes to the surrounding infrastructure, then it is probably worth.
<br>Then again, there is the question of environment. Our ancients worshipped nature and its infinite beauty. Are we preserving that nature or are we destroying that nature? Would our ancients, who adored nature, approve us on building monuments that destroy the same nature?
<br>I still don’t have enough budget numbers and detailed assessments. But, IF what I read in media is true, I’m not very happy. We have to spend more like the Indus Valley ancestors of ours - in drainages, roads and public utilities.
<br>The big question is do we want to be an Egyptian civilization or the Indus Valley civilization? Do we want to be a Shah Jahan or Shivaji?

What are the benefits which Modi personally will gain by taking huge risk of Demonetization?
<html><body>
<br>Narendra Modi is trying to avoid the fate that befell PV Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Two of the best Prime Ministers of modern times could not win the re-election and could not come back after spectacular terms.
<br>Both took hard decisions whose benefit could be seen only years later. Thus, most voters could not understand the immediate benefits when it was time for elections. 5 years is a bit short to see the impact of long term reforms. One of the disadvantages of democracy is that it forces the leaders to think bit short term.
<br>That is a risk for Modi despite him facing far less opposition and far more popularity than Rao or Vajpayee. He has done plenty of good projects in his first 2 years - including getting 99% of households with banking accounts, drastically improving access to toilets & power, brought one of the best budgets in India’s history, successful airlifting in Yemen, bankruptcy amendment, real estate transparency, basic pension for senior citizens, ran a period of peace with no major riots or terror bombings etc.
<br>However, he needs something big and memorable for voters to remember in 2019. Toilets and bank accounts and foreign policy wins and Yemen evacuation are fine - but they don’t make electoral victories on their own. Modi has never lost an election in his career ever since becoming an MLA and he would not want 2019 to be the first.
<br>Modi has to go for the “DLF Maximum” in this T20 democratic game. That means going after “black money”, rampant real estate inflation and corruption. He also had to go after OROP which was a long time demand that got implemented and fight for GST, which is going to get tougher. If in 2019, people can afford more things [when real estate prices fall, other prices fall too] and see more of the corrupt rich people fall down [most of whom have heavy real estate investments] they will be much more open to voting him.
<br>As the powerplay is ending, he is forced to go for the big risky shots that could potentially cost him in state elections, but get the run rate up for the end of the innings. And for all the criticism [including some of the right ones such as not increasing 100 rupee printing early enough and not starting 500 rupee printing soon enough] the government seems to be doing ok [if you want to see a poor demonetization implementation - look at Maduro’s in Venezuela].
<br>Modi also has learned lessons from Nehru and Indira. Both of them took some hard decisions - such as the Hindu personal law reform and bank nationalization. Both of them invited far stronger opposition, but the leaders survived them. On the other hand, the leaders who were a bit circumspect with their changes - Rao and Vajpayee were voted out.
<br>While discussing a case with a European multinational, my strategy professor in business school remarked that as a leader if you are bringing change, bring the hardest, biggest change early in the game. People are going to complain anyway of any change - hard or soft, big or small, but if it is a big change, the benefits could also be big.
<br>Modi dreams big and surely doesn’t want to become a one-term Prime Minister. He eyes the spot of Nehru and the personal gain he is going after is becoming the best PM of India.
<br>EDIT: A lot of people asked for data and here you go.

What do you think of Lt. Gen. Bipin Rawat's appointment as the Army Chief and the government’s decision to supersede two senior officers?
<html><body>
<br>It is a very surprising and a bold move. Normally, the army chief of India is selected only through seniority. Whoever is the most senior of the generals gets to be the army chief. Like in most government jobs, there is little merit in how someone gets a top job. For the first time, two Lt Generals have been bypassed to give Gen. Rawat the top role. [Why Lt General Bipin Rawat, the man who led surgical strikes in Myanmar, was best suited to be Army chief]
<br>The senior most general, Lt Gen Bakshi is from armoured corps [of leading tanks] an experience that is useful in a conventional war, not the kind of war on terrorists India is doing now.
<br>Who is this man?
<br>In short, it was a move where merit superseded seniority and an example of assertive governance Modi is doing.
<br>Since the army chief post was merely through seniority, there was also allegedly factionalism as people knew who would become the general and did chamchagiri around him. Is Lt General Bipin Rawats appointment an end of factionalism in Army?

After demonetization, which could be next step that needs to be taken by Indian Government to prevent black money and corruption?
<html><body>
<br>Prime minister in his recent speech suggested that he has some ideas post 30th Dec ‘16 to tackle black money and corruption.
<br>Here are some possibilities:
</body></html>
If Jayalalithaa (Amma) was so corrupt then why do the people support her so much?
<html><body>
<br>RIP Jaya
<br>I have heard when she was recently tried for Corruption case in Bangalore, many people committed suicide. Why ? What has she done for the welfare of Tamil Nadu ?
<br>Many outsiders have quite a bit of stereotypes and misunderstandings about Tamil parties. While I’m not a fan/voter of any of the Dravidian parties, it would be a grave injustice to reduce Jayalalitha to mere freebie politics.
<br>For many Tamils Jaya and her mentor MGR provide a deeply emotional connect that cannot be reduced to mere materialism of her branded canteens and TVs. For many women Jayalalitha is an inspirational role model who stood through ignominy and sexual harassment even in the legislative assembly and grew her politics from scratch - with no family background. For a group that was used to getting beaten by drunkard husbands, she is a shining sun.
<br>For many her guts and the ability to stand up to any kind of central government is a real attraction. For the last few decades, Tamils feared our own central government more than anything else. Language imposition and loss of economic sovereignty were real worries. For those who worried, Jaya proved that she can easily fend off any kind of central government or Prime Minister.
<br>For a few others, she was an educated, suave leader standing out from the cacophony of goondas. For a few others she was a policy expert who had the right scheme at the right time.
<br>While her first term as CM [1991–96] was truly horrible and a hallmark of corruption, her subsequent terms were quite measured and relatively clean. It is in these terms where she really earned the respect of the people. She was charismatic and people looked up to her.
<br>Here are a few things Jaya is known for:
<br>On the whole Tamil Nadu is a reasonably run state by Indian standards. It is a fairly safe, healthy, educated state with some decent infrastructure. Not all of this is due to Jaya and Karunanidhi, but these leaders do deserve some of the credit.
<br>Anybody who doesn’t understand Jayalalitha’s popularity doesn’t understand Tamil politics at all.
</body></html>
What does Balaji Vishwanathan think about death of 60+ people due to demonetisation?
<html><body>
<br>Many of those deaths reflect India’s fundamental problems and it is sad that rather than looking at those problems we have conveniently laid the blames on one scheme.
<br>For instance, look at this video and it is gruesome to me.
<br>A poor man has collapsed and the people around do business as though nothing happened. Modi didn’t kill him. The man could have collapsed in any queue that people stand everyday. The man was killed by the bystander’s apathy - of people’s inaction. Had anyone given the man some water and first aid, maybe the man could have been saved.
<br>Such things are quite routine for us and happen everyday - on days where people rush to ATMs and on days when nothing happens.
<br>Key issues:
<br>The problem is that the educated masses are not interested in policies and real problems. We try to look for quick scapegoats to blame. While the demonetization implementation has been less than ideal, a deeper look at the deaths caused show some of the fundamental problems that we suffer. And such deaths have been occurring everyday.
<br>If we put emphasis on those fundamental issues and push our governments to solve them, we can really avoid thousands of avoidable deaths that occur every year.

Why is that Northern CMs like Kejriwal, Nitish Kumar, Mamata get in fights with centre whereas Sourthern CMs like Chandrababu and Jayalalitha do not?
<html><body>
<br>I will answer this question with a combination of history, politics and geography.
<br>It is not about north vs south. No one cares what the Punjab or Rajasthan chief minister does and most outsiders don’t even know who the leaders of J&K, Himachal Pradesh or Assam are.
<br>It is about Ganga states vs the rest.
<br>The shaded region above is the Indo-Gangetic plain and the numbers both represent India’s geography and history. 1 is the region where the civilization was originally made. 2 and 3 are the places where epic was made [Ramayana, Mahabharata etc]. 4 was were history was made [Maurya, Gupta etc] and 5th is where the economy was made [especially in the modern era before and during the Raj]. Over few thousand years, the core gradually shifted from 1 to 5, before getting put back to the center in the 20th century.
<br>These 5 regions have immense control over India. Since the partition in 1947, the #1 went onto become Pakistan, part of #5 went on to what is now Bangladesh, leaving 2–4 to excise the power over the Indian politics.
<br>The Gangetic plain is a very well connected zone - from Haryana to Bengal. The river has a splendid and unimpeded flow and so does the culture of that region. The vast amount of linguistic similarities of that region is also owed to the Ganga. The flat land connected by a common river has excited leaders & empire builders for thousands of years.
<br>India is a hard place to get in. There are two routes to control India’s heart. The first option is to start from the western edge of Gangetic plains near Delhi and then move downstream. Or to get to the eastern edge of the Gangetic plains in Bengal and then move upstream. The former is the easier of the two and used by the Mughals among others. The second route, moving upstream of the river, is very hard and was successfully done only by the British. The local empires often started in the middle - usually in Pataliputra.
<br>Now, you see the key actors of Indian politics. On the western edge of Gangetic plains is Kejriwal and on the eastern edge sits Mamata. They both have empire ambitions and have to be as shrill as possible to showcase themselves as the key challenger to the throne. Both have to be quite loud to even stay in the game. One sits in the old capital and slightly old school approach and another sitting in the new capital and with a newer approach.
<br>In the middle are folks like Nitish Kumar and Akhilesh Yadav, who seem slightly more grounded “native” empire builders. Then there are colorful characters like Lalu and Mayawati who take the more rougher tone and could be significant power brokers even if they would never build an empire on their own.
<br>These are the ones who have to challenge Modi as they all have an empire at stake.
<br>There are times when powers outside the Gangetic plain attempt to move in. But, they have found it hard. The Maratha/Peshwas had the most spectacular of these attempts, but they found it hard to rule the country from the Deccan. The successor to the Peshwa empire - Tilak, Gokhale, Savarkar - tried the same with only limited success. Then the Gujaratis tried it with Gandhi and Patel and have had more success. But, the political power still reverted to the Ganges - with Nehru and Prasad [from UP and Bihar respectively] taking over the key positions post independence.
<br>There were other times when non-Ganga leaders - such as Rao, Manmohan and Morarji - had their hands at leadership. In each case they were brought by unusual circumstances and none of them had any major things named after them - speaking to their popularity with people.
<br>Modi is that one outsider to Gangetic plains who was able to break through the invisible barrier. He moved his fort to Varanasi and addresses people more often in Hindi than in Gujarati. Unlike Gandhi, Modi is ambitious as much as he is popular. For the first time in Indian history, we have an outsider to the gangetic plains, has huge popularity among public, vested with enormous power and still has the energy & ambition to build an empire.
<br>This is a scary prospect for the existing powers of the Ganga. They have to challenge this phenomenon.
<br>For the other powers outside of the Ganga - say Naidu of Andhra, Jayalalitha of Tamil Nadu, Patnaik of Odisha or Rao of Telangana - there is nothing scary about an outsider taking over the Ganga. None of them can become the Prime Minister of India irrespective of their qualities and skillsets and thus none of them feel as a challenger to Modi’s throne. Thus, they keep their ambition bottled and more willing to work with Modi.
<br>If you want to understand Indian politics or history, you have to understand the politics of Ganga.
<br>PS: As a sidenote look at the map and you will know why some state partitions in the north succeeded and some didn’t. Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Himachal are outside the shaded region and thus they could be easily split off from UP, Bihar and Punjab respectively. On the other hand the further split of UP and Bihar is marred by political drama.

How can a young person contribute to Indian politics?
<html><body>
<br>I am an 18 year old Indian. My soul saddens after seeing so many corrupt politicians in our country. Indian politics needs more educated and altruistic politicians.
<br>I don’t have any political background/contacts. How can I contribute on my part?
<br>If you want to really contribute to politics, don’t straightaway get into politics.
<br>There are two types of politicians. The first start as social reformers and activists. They spend majority of their time there. Eventually their social work lead them naturally into politics. They tend to make an impact because they care so much about their cause.
<br>The second group gets into politics because they are attracted to power. Power is the most addictive drug in the world. It doesn’t matter whether you are educated or illiterate - attempting that power directly will corrupt and ruin you. These politicians are the scourge of this world - no matter whether they are educated, poor or from rural areas.
<br>Think of Gandhi, Nehru, Rajaji and Patel. Or Netaji, Ambedkar and Periyar. Or Modi, Obama, Mandela and Vajpayee. Or Mandela and Suu Kyi. All of these people spent majority of their career as activists. Obama campaigned for the poor people’s voting rights in Chicago. Years of activism later he got into politics. Modi spent the first 50 years of his life in social activism. Politics naturally followed. You might or might not agree with their social activism, but you cannot deny their impact.
<br>On the other hand there are plenty of politicians who never started as social reformers or activists. Such as Rahul Gandhi and his parents. They would be tarred in the field of politics and even if they succeed they will only be a burden on the system.
<br>In short, if you really want to help politics, don’t start with politics. Only the scoundrels and power maniacs do so.
<br>Instead, spend time in social activism. Pick a cause and fight for it. It could be for poor people’s rights, environment rights, women’s rights, economic freedom, cultural restoration, fighting corruption etc. For days and months and years and even decades stick on with your fight even when the no one notices you. One day you will be so prepared that if you are smart you will find that the path to power is cleared - not because you desired, but because you deserved.

How can India go cashless with just 30% of population having smartphones?
<html><body>
<br>With 220mn users, India is now world’s second-biggest smartphone market
<br>[For all those who think India has gone online on 08/11/2016]
<br>Courtesy a Quora answer.
<br>People assume that less educated and poor economies like India should not go cashless. On the contrary, India should go cashless because it is poor. Financial inclusion is necessary for poverty alleviation and corruption reduction.
<br>It is not the technology that is in our way. It is our attitudes. This is why a big shock treatment is needed for Indians to change our ways of our lives.

What will happen if all of the black money holders burn the money or do not submit at all? Wouldn't it lead to loss of money?
<html><body>
<br>It could be good for India even if the people burn their black money. Normally there are 3 issues with burning money:
<br>All the 3 cases are irrelevant in the present case. RBI is anyway going to burn the money and anyway taking these old notes off circulation. Since it is printing the new notes and sending through the system it also has better info how much money is sent into the system. Thus, you save the bank officials some time in burning it yourself.
<br>In essence, it is providing free money to the government. Each note you carry is liability of RBI/Government and when you burn the liability, you are gifting the system. Assuming that government is printing 16 lakh crore worth of new notes in place of the 16 lakh crore worth of old notes, any amount that didn’t come into the bank is a gain for the government [figuratively, they can use the printed notes for social programmes] .
<br>Also, a person burning the money in this case is likely to be involved in illegal activities and having that person lose money/have less power, is good for the society.
<br>There will be some negative impact on the society though. That bad guy might have spent some of that money on luxury goods, cars and hotels. Now, those will see lesser sales and in turn will reduce the GDP. To compensate, the government could use the extra money it obtained and spend it on infrastructure investments - schools, hospitals, roads and railways. These could more than compensate for the GDP hit got by reduced consumption of the bad people.

What's your opinion of State Bank Of India writing Off loans Of 63 Wilful defaulters and also Rs 1201 Crore Of Vijay Mallya just after demonetization?
<html><body>
<br>Source :State Bank Of India Writes Off Loans Of 63 Wilful Defaulters, Rs 1201 Crore Of Vijay Mallya Also Written Off
<br>Edit : I am neither an AAP supporter nor a BJP worker. I just asked a question or opinions of others with regards to this move .
<br>People are confused with “write off” means here. Write off doesn’t mean Mallya need not return the loan. Write off means that State Bank of India doesn’t assure its investors that it can get back the amount.
<br>Banks give loans to people and sometimes the people don’t return. These loans are termed “Non-Performing Assets”. A high NPA is negative for a bank and also means the bank is unreal. Often times the banks would realize that the borrower would never repay. This purging happens periodically. In those cases, they will take it from their assets. Their assets and value would come down to reality.
<br>While this happens in their balancesheet, the bank’s loan department can continue to pursue the defaulters if and when they find that the defaulter can afford to pay.

Will the BJP gain politically after the recent currency demonetization as their leaders had prior knowledge about it?
<html><body>
<br>The Prime Minister Narendra Modi belongs to BJP, as he had prior knowledge about currency Demonetization didn't he make sure that the BJP converted all their Black money to white money before the Demonetization policy came into effect.
<br>I would agree with Mr. Awdhesh Singh. BJP leaders didn’t know about it. Only the PM did. If he looked at it just from a political angle, it does not make sense at all. At a time when BJP’s prospects looked up in UP, now it is back to square one [Demonetisation: Has BJP scored a self goal in UP ahead of polls? Modis December rally deferred].
<br>Ahead of a major election, no calculating politician would bring such a risky move. All the angry people in the ATMs, all the weddings postponed and other short-term pain would all translate to political risk. BJP is especially the party that will be the hurt the most as its core base is small shopkeepers and businesses who are hurt a lot. And BJP is also among the richest parties - as they have the most political power. Thus, they are hurt both in their currency chest and among votes.
<br>These are the reasons why most politicians would do feel-good stuff for short-term. Nobody wants the ire of the public. Like placating children with chocolates and sugar, they are more than willing to do stuff that will not carry any short risk.
<br>This is why Modi’s move is lauded. Even at the cost of hurting his own party and his own electoral chances, he took a gutsy move that will help India in the long term - the first step in going cashless. Countries around the world have done this - most developed countries have already demonetized their higher denomination notes.

What is Hawala? And what is the Hawala scandal?
<html><body>
<br>Hawala is a distributed banking network that is not regulated. It is often used either to avoid transaction fees or to avoid questions being raised about the money transferred.
<br>When I was young, I saw a relative of mine needing to send a huge amount to Australia. That was his earned money, but the government didn’t allow him to get the Australian dollars to send to his new home. Thus, he called up a local guy who came with a gunny bag of US dollars and took his rupees instead. It was crazy, as that guy came in a rusted cycle and looked rag-tag, but still was handling an amount in his bag that could have bought a big bungalow in a major city.
<br>How did he get US dollars? Let’s see a simple network.
<br>Mike wants to get 1 million rupees for his new business in India. The transaction is set at 50 rupees to dollar and he gives 20,000 dollars to the NYC hawala guy Mohammad. Mohammad calls his buddy Monu in Delhi and asks him to pay 1 million rupees when Mike gets to Delhi. Ok bro, no problem he says.
<br>In turn, Monu was given 1.20 million by Mahesh who wants to get dollars for his studies in NYC. Mahesh wants $15000 for his studies and pays 1.20 million to Monu at a rate of 80 rupees to a dollar. When Mahesh gets to NYC, he will be paid $15000 by Mohammad.
<br>At the end of it, Mike gets 1 million rupees for his business and Mahesh gets $15000 for his studies. Mohammad got $20000 from Mike and paid $15000 to Mahesh. He has $5000 in profit. His buddy Monu got 1.2 million from Mahesh and paid 1 million to Mike. He has 200,000 rupees as profit. Everyone is happy and no questions was asked.
<br>They pretty much works like a bank but with no proof or paper trail.
<br>Why is this a problem? If no questions are asked you could send any amount for any purpose. Mike might want that 1 million rupees to pay a corrupt NGO for bribing an Indian government official. Mahesh might want the $15000 for taking illicit money out of the country.

Why did violence in Kashmir stop suddenly? What is real reason behind it.
<html><body>
<br>It has not stopped, but taking a bit of pause the last couple of days. Even on Friday there was an incident in Kupwara, although there are no reports of violence in the rest of the valley in the past few days.
<br>A lot of the violence in Jammu & Kashmir is funded through illicit money. With Modi’s demonetization it has become quite hard to fund terrorism. Modi has not surprised just you and me, but these “poor” terrorists too.
<br>The J&K police has reported to New Delhi that separatists are flummoxed by the move as a result of which the four-month long agitation may be on the backburner. The separatist leaders rely on hawala channels through Bangladesh, Nepal and Dubai for funding the agitation. It is these sources that have dried up.. Top intelligence officials say the Kashmir agitation will be on the backburner for at least four to five months, the time required to replenish separatist coffers through the black money route.
<br>Demonetisation drives Kashmir Valley agitation into hawala dead-end
<br>This won’t be a permanent thing, but gives enough breathing space for our security agencies to plan and our political leaders to think of solutions. The demonetization is a part of the government’s big game plan and extends far beyond just fighting black money.

Why won't people go back to hiding black money since new 2k and 500 notes are issued?
<html><body>
<br>Let’s say there is this big dilapidated building. It has not been maintained in years and years of dirt has accumulated there. Somebody comes there, cleans up years of dirt and gives a fresh coat of painting. Rather than marveling at that, you are taking a nihilistic approach [EDIT: if you don’t understand what nihilism means refer to Nihilism before commenting] saying that the paint will wear out in a few years. Sure, the paint will wear out and things will get dirty. So what? Is that an excuse for not painting today?
<br>Sure, the Rs. 2000 introduction is a controversial. However, there is still a need for high denomination notes for the foreseeable future until we all move cashless and paint the home once again [remove all the high value currencies]. RBI in fact wanted higher denomination notes [Rs. 5000] as there is heavy transaction costs involved for banks with lower denomination notes. Think of all the effort for them to move money [they need 20x more transport to move money in 100 rupees alone] in lower denominations and the extra time of cashiers to count 20x extra notes. That is an extra burden on our banks and other money handlers.
<br>There is always a balance needed. You need to both ensure proper functioning of the economy [just the inflation would mean the Rs. 1000 notes introduced nearly 20 years ago is equivalent to over Rs. 8000 now] and that has to be balanced against the need for a clean economy. Clean and functioning. Both are needed. If Rs. 500 notes were needed 20 years ago, then we need a lot of Rs. 2000 now.
<br>Now, getting back to black. By World Bank estimates 25% of India’s wealth is in black [http://finmin.nic.in/press_room/...]. That is a low estimate, but let’s take that. India’s total wealth is nearly $4 trillion [note: this is not the GDP] or about 280 lakh crore rupees.
<br>If a quarter of it is black that is nearly 70 lakh crore rupees. A lot of it will be in real estate, gold and some in cash. Assuming 10% of black is cash that is a whopping 7 lakh crore rupees of bad money sloshing around the system. Like a disease the black money only increases black money and bribery. The first goal is to attack this 7 lakh crores that is in cash. It is a mind boggling number. That is 3 times the India’s budget for national defense.
<br>In parallel, there will also be an attack on the rest 63 lakh crore of black money, mostly in real estate. The attack on cash will bring down real estate values and that will evaporate a lot of this black money. As this wealth gets destroyed there will be a deflation and the government can then afford to print a lot of money, paying for some national spending programs. In a way there is transfer of money amounting to lakhs of crores from the black money holders to the government.
<br>That is a humongous achievement. If this were the only thing the government did in 5 years, you can complain. But, they are in parallel attacking black money in different directions. Bringing GST is a way to bring everyone in tax net and cut black money. Aadhar card implementation is a way to reduce black money. Then there was the scheme to declare black money [Declare black money by September 30 or face action: PM Modi] that brought nearly 65000 crore rupees out.
<br>Then there was the investigation teams for black money, the Jhan Dhan Yojana, the incentives for payment services, direct benefits transfer etc. Sure, these are programs the previous government started, but Modi administration is doubling hard on these and the combined effect would be to clean the nation. Again, there would be many such moves coming up. On the whole it is an attack on all fronts.

Why didn't the Indian government use some other freedom fighter than Gandhiji on new notes introduced in November 2016?
<html><body>
<br>Which other freedom fighter is more acceptable to Indians?
<br>Nehru? He is controversial and offend many, especially in the right wing.
<br>Patel? He will offend the “secularists”. His party itself worked so hard to bury his legacy and forget his name.
<br>Bose? Will offend a lot of people at the center, who don’t believe his methods.
<br>Rajaji? Even the Tamils have forgotten him and ask most northerners and you will draw a blank.
<br>Tilak? Oh, he was a “Hindutva” guy.
<br>Tagore? Some people still think he wrote the anthem for King George.
<br>Then someone would say why no women representation? We will add a Sarojini Naidu. Then someone would say you have picked only the upper castes. Let’s add an Ambedkar. Why no non-Hindu representation? We will add a Abul Kalam Azad. Why no Sikhs, Jains, Christians? Why nobody from the left? Why no representation from my region? From my state? From my community? Why only freedom fighters and why not singers, kings, religious leaders? How about Kalam? Ok. The person who was opposed by the left and Congress. In any case, if contemporary leaders are added, how about Indira Gandhi, Vajpayee, Kamaraj, Rajiv Gandhi, some might ask. Others might be bit more sensible and ask for Homi Bhaba and Vikram Sarabhai. Then someone would say Sachin has to be there and then another angry group would say it should be Dhyan Chand.
<br>As your head starts spinning, you would see Bapu smiling. For all you might hate him, he is the one most acceptable to India and just look at the comments section below to see how many different options people have. And I end with this Aesop’s fable:

If Trump sends back Indians, is it good for Indian economy or Bad?
<html><body>
<br>Supposedly these people come back to India, they will take away the average Indians job. There will be more job scarcity and average people will just not survive. But some people says it will bring more job but how?
<br>First, the premise is wrong. Trump is not likely to send Indians back home. Trump’s voters are blue collar workers and they care about blue collar jobs. There are not many blue collar jobs outsourced to India. On the other hand, Clinton’s voters are white collar workers and they are usually the strongest on outsourcing topics.
<br>Maybe there would be some clampdown on H1b abusing greymarket companies, but such clampdown would help legitimate seekers from India who will have more room to breathe on the lottery front. On the whole, I don’t see many Indians impacted by Trump.
<br>That said, if many educated Indians come back to India on their own volition, that would be time to party. We will welcome them back home, help them settle and build a stronger India. It is an exciting time for us in India and a lot of cool technology to be built.

How did Donald Trump win the 2016 Presidential Election?
<html><body>
<br>He middle fingered the establishment and acted as though they didn’t matter.
<br>A friend posted in Facebook something along the lines of “if only the blacks voted for Hillary as much they did Obama…”. Essentially he is saying the blacks care more about the race and shifted the blame. Ironically, he was supporting “race equality”. Then a guy blaming Jill for taking Green votes. As though it is a crime to support green. Leave alone the fact that the green party took away no Hillary votes in the key states.
<br>I’m surprised that even after the results staring so much in the face, some are in denial - blaming the third parties, blaming the “fence sitters”, blaming the people who didn’t turn up, blaming the blacks for turning out enough, blaming the white females and so on. My Facebook friends have blamed each one of these groups in the past few hours.
<br>In fact, there is no proof that the third party candidates took votes from Clinton. It is more likely for them to have taken from Trump, where even many traditional republicans openly stood against. Even George Bush didn’t vote for his party candidate [Trump thinks 'it's sad' George W Bush voted 'None of the Above']. That means Trump was able to find a voice far bigger than even the Republican party.
<br>The white women vote was nearly split even. That after all the revelations about Trump’s uncharitable comments. Surely, not all those of the women were misogynists. Something must have troubled them far more to go to the polls & vote for Trump, keeping down their disgust.
<br>Same with the Hispanics who voted more with the Republicans than in the recent times. That after his statements about the wall. Surely, something bigger must have been there to keep down their inhibitions on racism.
<br>This is part of the common people’s revolution against the establishment. They don’t trust their politicians. Their media. Their diplomats. Their administrators. They felt let down by their economists. They fear about their jobs and culture. They fear something existential issue about their way of life. And when people have existential fears, they suppress all other inhibitions.
<br>The more the media talked about Trump’s failures, the more it looked like the establishment colluding. It was as though everyone was conspiring against Trump. To defeat that establishment was more important for many than their own inhibitions on gender and race issues. And it completely didn’t matter that Trump was unrefined, uninformed and politically wrong. In fact, those are the precise things that made him anti-establishment.
<br>His blathering about nuclear triad and other topics, rather than harming him actually helped him. People saw him as an ordinary Joe and the Joes don’t go well prepared in public talking. People saw that as honest and down to earth in the same way as they saw GW Bush. In contrast HRC was super well rehearsed - almost to the level of a robot. People didn’t care about what she said, but just noted the way she said it. That reminded them of the establishment - a scheming individual.
<br>And more the media talked about HRC’s virtues and Trump’s uncouthness, more the people saw a need to back Trump. It was their fight against the elite. And my liberal friends had no idea that they were in an echo chamber. They completely tuned out anything they find deplorable.
<br>This revolution is hardly limited to the US. It is happening across the world. In Arab Spring, many of the established governments were toppled in the Middle East. In Brexit, the British voters middle fingered all the mainstream parties. In Philippines, the new President is completely fingering US and going straight with his executions of drug addicts. In India and Indonesia, the voters elevated promising provincial chiefs to premiers in 2014, both of whom coming from poor backgrounds.
<br>And it is just the beginning. Across Europe and elsewhere in the world changes are happening to the post-WW2 coalitions and political arrangements.
<br>Everywhere, there is an anger against the establishment. Anger against the status quo. Like in the late 18th century, this is the worst time to be a part of the elite.
<br>People around the world have gotten existential worries about their culture, economic status and the ability to continue their way of life. For them it looks like the liberals are pushing the reforms way too fast and without paying heed to their opinions.
<br>As the liberals tar them as being outdated, racists and uneducated [and as Hillary mentioned deplorables], the angry commoners often mask their anger and don’t reveal enough of their preferences in public [not a single person on my FB feed supported Trump even though I know many secretly support him]. This is why the opinion polls don’t reveal the complete picture. Also, many liberals measure public opinion through media and completely miss the fire building up underneath.
<br>As the liberals brush aside these concerns and don’t try to address them, these voters stop trusting anything to do with the former. Historically, people have fought the hardest when their way of life is threatened. Liberals for all their alleged grasp of history, failed to go beyond endlessly quoting the 1932 elections in the Weimar republic, and failed to see the history of revolutions and civil wars.
<br>As the words Fascism and Nazism got thrown too easily, the shock value completely evaporated. If every right wing leader was Hitler, then there was nothing special or shocking about getting branded as Hitler. If the previous Hitlers around the world didn’t end the world, why would this new Hitler?
<br>Ultimately, it is an anger that existed for a long time and in hindsight it is not hard to see a Trump victory. He won way many states that were thought to be solidly democrat. He won far more Hispanic votes than Mitt Romney. And he won a sizable chunk of the immigrants and more surprisingly a sizable chunk of the females. So much for all the buzzfeed worthy charts posted by Nate Silver. Trump won despite his embarrassing revelations about women and despite the Republican leadership quitting on him. That should show the level of anger underneath. This anger is not all from racists, white supremacists and misogynists, KKK supporters, etc.
<br>Revolutions often turn up leaders who are far worse than the establishment they toppled. But, they also help heal things over the long run.
<br>In a way this is good for the US. Like a pressure cooker releasing pressure, this is an election to let out that built-up pressure & anger in a less violent way. Hopefully this is an election that will let both sides see the other’s point. The “us vs them” attitude and the uncharitable attitudes of the other side has to end.

What do you think of the decision by the Indian Government to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes?
<html><body>
<br>Will it help in curbing black money and corruption?
<br>Withdrawing high denomination currency notes [demonetization] has been done before [1946, 1978]. However, I believe the present move [2016] might have a bigger impact than the one done by British India and Morarji Desai. This is a move I have been dreaming for years and glad that it was done.
<br>The fact that the government was able to do this so secretly in such a connected manner speaks volumes. Indira Gandhi tried this in early 1970s, but could not as the move leaked out and the bad guys quickly changed over the notes. The government had to back out of the move then. I’m even thinking if the move to ban NDTV was just a ploy to distract the whole media, to pull this off. And it was possibly scheduled on US election day likely to get the global media off the heat and attention, as foreign media has been ultracritical & condescending of any major move in India.
<br>There are 5 key incentives for this:
<br>As the 6th incentive, it would impact coalitions ahead of the major elections in UP and Punjab. It is not shocking that elections, especially in these states with multidimensional politics [a lot of parties fighting] involve a lot of illicit money. MLAs get traded like horses - with suitcases of cash. Some of that trading will get impacted.
<br>Unlike in the past, I don’t see much impact on normal users of currency. The transactions that happen on Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 should be moving to netbanking/cheque/cards anyway. If someone is still holding out against modern transaction methods, this is the opportunity to come out from under the rock.
<br>For the poor who don’t have debit/credit cards, there might not be much impact either - as most of their transaction happen under Rs. 500.
<br>Impact of the move
<br>1. Black Money & corruption: The impact on black money usage will be temporary as those would eventually move to the new Rs. 2000 notes in time. Also, a lot of the black money lies in real estate, gold and other physical things. Still even a temporary, small impact on this sector is better than nothing. The mere fear of government taking out your black money is good enough. That the government could so secretly do this will increase the fear.
<br>2. Elections: Especially with the major elections barely weeks away, the move would impact politics in the crucial states. My guess is that the government waited for the Diwali to pass [will be a huge pain for many to have this move before the festival] and do it reasonably before the elections [EC could throw a spanner on any major move just before the elections]. Thus, unlike the previous occasions, the government didn’t do this on January 16. It could have impact on corruption in those elections and it is a way of the government saying, “Maha Gathbandhan, Check”.
<br>3. Counterfeiting: The impact on the counterfeit notes would be more significant. Many “dealers” with the existing counterfeit notes would be stuck as they would have to take the notes to the bank and have better chances of getting their racket exposed. Thus, they are more likely to destroy their notes and incur losses. Losses to the bad guys is good and maybe some of them could get shot unable to pay their debts. It would be quite hard to counterfeit the new currency and until they develop the technology for that, there will be an impact on counterfeit notes and terrorism that is funded through that.
<br>4. Cashless society. All of the above things are temporary things. But, I believe the long lasting one could be in moving cashless. The pain of transferring cash could incentivize many to think about going bits and plastic. Today could be a day to introspect for the legal users of the currency. That could have a more significant impact on counterfeiting and unaccounted money.
<br>5. Gold/silver. In the short term, gold and silver buying will be hampered, as a lot of the buyers buy with their black money. That means less importing. Over the long term, there might be more purchase of gold as the black money guys will be afraid to hold too much cash.
<br>6. Real Estate. In the short term, prices of real estate would come down for the same reason above. There will be less suitcases moving. It is not clear what would happen to this sector in the long term. Maybe there could be a little more land buying, but that could be neutralized by the spiraling down of the prices that could go now.
<br>7. Markets. This is overall a positive move that is lauded by a lot of people and could bring more confidence in Indian markets by overseas investors. However, the exit of black money temporarily could cause other repercussions in buying. I would not be surprised if the market goes a bit down in the short and medium term.
<br>8. Overseas Indians. There is a lot of INR that gets transacted outside of India. Technically it is illegal [NRIs, foreigners can’t leave with rupee], but there are not many practical alternatives. They would be impacted as they cannot change the money to the new notes quickly and those overseas currency trading markets on rupee would be impacted [UAE money exchanges won’t accept notes in India recall]. Some of these transactions are good ones that improve the economy, while others might help Dawood bhai like ones.
<br>9. Banking to all. The government’s key objective is to bring banking to all and this will help that. If you have more than Rs. 4000, the bank will not give you new notes, but will just ask you to open an account and credit it there. This when followed with the fees on ATM transactions will make it harder to transact on cash.
<br>10. Consumption and economy. This is one thing I believe it is going to be negative. Black money drives a lot of the economy and now that it is gone, it will impact consumption levels. There could be a deflation and damp economic growth for a couple of quarters. In the long run it doesn’t matter though.
<br>Think about this. India’s total tangible wealth is of the order of 280 lakh crores. World bank estimates at least a quarter of this is black. That means 70 lakh crores. It is possible that 10% of it is in cash, with the rest in real estate and gold. That is 7 lakh crores of black cash that is lying around. Maybe 80% of it will turn white and even with that Rs 1.4 lakh crores of black will be gone. That is big.
<br>The government gave the black money holders enough time [until Sept 30] to come clean [Black money: Rs. 65,250 crore disclosed under Income Declaration Scheme] and following up on its warnings would make them take the government seriously in this aspect.
<br>On the whole, the government has announced that it is alive and bold. At a time it looked like the government was sagging and losing speed, it is a time to reinvigorate.

Isn't it hypocrisy on part of Narendra Modi/BJP that the schemes like GST and Adhaar which they once opposed to in Congress rule are being implemented now?
<html><body>
<br>The BJP while in opposition asked the govt to abandon Adhaar in spite of the enormous investment into it. Narendra Modi while being the CM of Gujarat opposed the GST amendment. Don't these show the pettiness of BJP’s politics bringing their political interest in front of national interest?
<br>GST process was kickstarted by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government in 2000. GST Bill: How the tax reform advanced through the years
<br>The Aadhar process also started by Vajpayee especially after the Kargil war to provide better identity to the Indians. History of Aadhar- How Aadhar comes into existence?
<br>When it comes to the nuclear deal, Vajpayee once again kickstarted the process with the US. 10 yrs of Indo-US civil nuclear deal: Transformation of the bilateral relationship is the real big deal - The deal however was not sealed during Vajpayee’s regime as India didn’t get what it wanted [such as assured access to the nuclear fuel] - Why Vajpayee didn't sign the nuclear deal.
<br>Is not it sheer hypocrisy that those claiming Modi is hypocrite, don’t even bother to mention previous BJP government’s role in these bills? I mean come on - ain’t you a cutie little pot calling the kettle black?
<br>When people say GST, Aadhar or nuclear deal are Congress ideas, they are ignorant of history. A lot of this got their conception in the previous BJP regime. Again, Vajpayee didn’t operate in vacuum. For some of the ideas he executed, such as taking India nuclear he utilized the work of his predecessors. That is the beauty democracy - behind the cacophony on the surface lies a lot of understanding.
<br>Now, the question is why did they oppose these deals as an opposition. In case of nuclear deal, they didn’t hamper the process, it was the Communists who pulled the rug. In other deals, sure part of it is politics - of denying the ruling party the credit. Part of it is BJP’s own indirection - between 2004 and 2014, it was very weak and leaderless.
<br>But, a key part is how bills work in a system like ours. Most of us don’t care to educate us on how these bills and deals work. I will try to explain here.
<br>Let’s say you are looking for a new home. A prospective house owner quotes rent at Rs. 30,000 and doesn’t paint it new. So, you say no. Then after a while the house owner agrees to reduce the price to Rs. 25,000 and also would paint, along with a new RO system. Now, you say yes.
<br>The house owner is the same, the house is the same. However, you said no once, but yes once. How? Because, the details of arrangement changed. The devil is in the details.
<br>The same thing happens to our bills considered in the Parliament. They are not static, but one that is constantly changed through negotiations. If you negotiate that hard for a paltry Rs. 25 thousand, imagine how hard a negotiation would go for a thing involving 25 lakh crores. These bills run for thousands of pages with all the minute details over which the lawyers, err, politicians fight.
<br>The GST bill changed a lot over the course of 15 years. Same for the Aadhar. In case of Aadhar, it would be criminal for the Modi government to not utilize it after the taxpayers spent so much on.
<br>Besides that, there is also a change in roles. Let’s say you take a fine work of software to a star tester or a blackhat security researcher. That person would still be able to find bugs and holes. Their job is to find that one gap and not to revel on the greatness in the software. The same is true of a lawyer/banker evaluating your business proposals or an art critic evaluating a movie/music performance. Their job is to point out to the few areas of failure, while it is the job of the performer to defend the work. As long as they don’t stop the work due to that [this shameful thing of stopping the Parliament has been done by all opposition parties] it is not harmful, but by design.
<br>You can either continue to whine about politics being a drainage, the politicians are all hypocrites blah blah blah, or educate yourself about politics. They are not saints [thankfully not], but ruthless negotiators with self-interest.

Why does PM Modi celebrate Deepavali every year with the Indian Army, when he does not celebrate Ramzaan/Ramadan? Isn't India a secular country?
<html><body>
<br>As the head of a secular country with no official State religion, should not PM Modi refrain from celebrating only certain popular festivals at taxpayers’ expense while ignoring other popular festivals from communities different than his own?
PS: Emphasize on “with Indian Army”
<br>You mean like this? PM Modi hails Muslim community on occasion of Ramzan [2015] & PM Narendra Modi greets Muslims as holy month of Ramzan begins [2016].
<br>Modi does share celebrations with the Muslims on Ramzan. One point disproved.
<br>Next, secularism is not atheism. If you are expecting Modi not to celebrate a Hindu festival, you are effectively imposing your religious views/ideals on a person. That is unconstitutional.
<br>More importantly, Diwali is not just a Hindu festival, it is an Indian festival. It is a core part of Indian culture as it evolved from this land and is celebrated by the majority. By fighting against such cultural elements, you are trying to remove the essence of India from India. That is unconstitutional too.
<br>In fact, not only should Modi celebrate it as an individual, but celebrate as the PM too. Deepavali is a truly Indian festival that spans multiple religions, multiple geographies, multiple cultural systems.

If Sundar Pichai is an American citizen, serves a company in America and pays taxes, why should Indians boast about him being brought up in India?
<html><body>
<br>For any poor, depressed community there is a strong need for role models who look like them. This is the reason why feminists push for more female representation in the board rooms and why Dalits keep a full suited imagery of Ambedkar.
<br>A suppressed group has a terrible problem with the “I can’t” syndrome. Children there assume that they are destined to be low and believe that successful people have something different that their group cannot have. After years of indoctrination, their belief becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.
<br>India as a whole is a suppressed group. Since the dawn of colonialism we don’t have very many success stories to look up to [as a friend of mine recently posed: can you name one engineer born in independent India who is your engineering role model?]. Many of our students buy into the racial idea of Indians being a weaker group.
<br>What the success stories of Kalpana Chawla, Subramaniam Chandrasekhar, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella does is it help partially break the shackles we put on ourselves. Their stories show that you can succeed in the brown skin and they could thus become role models.
<br>It really matters nothing on what colour of passports they have, where they live and what their attitudes towards India are. What really matters is, they can succeed and so can other brown skinned people studying in poor schools and growing up in a rote based system.
<br>That belief is a very powerful thing.
<br>As the next stage, we also have to create powerful role models at home - to break the next round of illusion that brown skinned people have to settle in the white lands to succeed. Once such role models emerge, more confident students will bring their best without worrying about visas.
<br>Let’s not try to underestimate the power of role models.

If America, instead of India, was facing constant firing from Pakistan, how would have American defence tackled the situation?
<html><body>
<br>If we replace ‘Indian’ defence, government, media, citizens with ‘American’, I wonder how harsh decisions would they have taken. Please keep in mind that USA and Pak are assumed as neighbors here in a hypothetical situation.
<br>United States’ response might not be very different from India’s.
<br>Pakistan’s establishment most likely hid America’s most wanted terrorist. Osama brazenly attacked New York and other cities in a bigger way than Pakistan’s attack on Mumbai. Osama Bin Laden killed Americans everywhere and he was happily living next to Pakistan’s army HQ. What did the US do? Bomb Pakistan? No. They did a surgical strike and continued to work with Pakistan. Pakistani leaders knew Osama bin Laden was in Pakistan, says former defense minister
<br>US knows most of global terrorism comes from Saudi Arabia. They might also know that Saudi Arabian establishment is supporting these groups in various ways. American soldiers die due to these actions. Saudi Arabia Can't Hide From the Truth. What do the Americans do? Work with the Saudis.
<br>Cuba emptied its jails and sent its most ardent criminals to the United States. Criminals 'in exodus from Cuba': US fears Castro emptying his jails. What did the US do? Bomb Cuba? No. They just gritted their teeth and moved on.
<br>US faces a massive drug war in its south. A lot of illegal immigrants and drug lords easily cross over into its borders. Although US is often displeased with the efforts of the Mexican government in tackling this, they continue to work on.
<br>In 1986, Libya sponsored terrorists bombed a discotheque frequented by US soldiers. 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing. US did a bit of attack in return, but didn’t do anything significant. Then Gaddafi bombed an American airline killing 243 passengers. Pan Am Flight 103. Gaddafi continued to stay on and the Americans resumed attack on him only after he was a spent force.
<br>In 1993, the American special forces fighting in Somalia were gruesomely killed and paraded. The movie Black Hawk Down portrays those incidents well. What did President Clinton do? Pull troops out of Somalia.
<br>During the cold war, Americans knew that China, USSR and North Korea were in various ways helping the North Vietnam it was fighting. What did the Americans do? Fight China or USSR? Nope. Despite having far more arms than China, they shouted hard in the UN and that’s it. Chinese and Soviet involvement in Vietnam
<br>US did go after the dead snakes - like in case of Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan - weakened by decades of war. Pakistan’s army and population is bigger than all of them put together, is nuclear armed and has long borders with India. Again, in all these cases, US made a bad problem worse by destabilizing an already fallible structure.
<br>Some Indians have this weird notion that Pakistan problem could be solved in a major showdown. Indian leaders always knew it would not. Vajpayee knew. Nehru knew. And Modi knows. Their rhetoric all toned down once they were in charge of managing affairs.
<br>American ships and planes and cities were attacked through actors from supposed allies. In comparison, both Uri and Pathankot involved lesser casualties. Why do you think US would immediately bomb?
<br>Pakistan is partly like Saudi Arabia - in that parts of its establishment is funding terrorists, while other parts might pretend to fight it. How else could you answer the terrorist bombing of Pakistan’s police academies, military bases etc.
<br>Pakistan is partly like Somalia - in that there is massive anarchy in waiting if India gets there and assuming India can destroy their army. Even a nuclear Armageddon will not reduce the problem. Pakistan is not just a sponsor of terrorism, it is also its biggest victim. Terrorists kill far more people in Pakistan than in India. [Fatalities in Terrorist Violence in Pakistan 2003-2016 and South Asia Terrorism portal].
<br>We cannot change our neighbors and we cannot change our neighbors*. We have to protect ourselves and continue to do business. We have no other alternative.
<br>In most ways terrorism from there is like the earthquake. We can do very little to prevent. What we can do is to protect ourselves and strengthen our structures.

Which two political parties do you want to see in government and main opposition in India in 2019?
<html><body>
<br>As a BJP supporter, I would want BJP to win in 2019. However, as an India supporter things get a bit tough. Political parties almost always lose steam in their second term. The zest that is there at the start often morphs into infighting by the end of the second term.
<br>We saw this in Congress - Nehru, Indira and Manmohan all lost their minds as time passed. Nehru was ridiculed internationally and demolished a lot of his reputation & honor at the end of the China war. Indira Gandhi became an uncontrollable tyrant by the end of her second term. Manmohan’s was mired in endless corruption and misgovernance by the end of his second term. It might seem hard to believe - but they all had thumping wins in their first term.
<br>Sure, Modi can do a lot better than them. However, I’m not so sure about the second rung leaders of the BJP. Can they keep their edge until the end?
<br>In any case, we don’t have an alternative to Modi and thus I would want him back in 2019.
<br>That would mean we need a very powerful and sane opposition party. The party should not get into defensive antics like “award wapsi” and waste time of the government, the Parliament and people. But, that party would have to be a powerful watchdog that passes the right bills, but grills the government well on its policies - especially in education, defense, economy, business friendliness etc. Not one to blame every single murder by random people on the PM, but push hard on security and freedom to profess religion. All logic, no bakwas. We don’t have such a major party yet. If a party like Lok Satta under JP could grow till there in the next 3 years, that would be great.

Question from Pakistani to Indians: even after 70 years of stable democracy, why is Indian political system so corrupted and governance inefficient ?

<br>I found this interesting article in Dawn. Can some of us(Indians) explain this ?
<br>Even if Indian democratic system is stable and robust, why are politicians corrupt and governance inefficient.
<br>Three questions from Pakistan that India needs to answer
<br>I’m not sure that the DAWN op-ed: Three questions from Pakistan that India needs to answer is a sincere one. For DAWN’s standards, it was of pretty poor quality.
<br>First, the author asks how India can be corrupt if it is also democratic. The assumption is that democracy is a magic wand that removes all illnesses. For its size and poverty, India ranks fairly well in the Corruption Perceptions Index. 100 nations [including China and Pakistan] rank behind India. Of the poorer countries, only 4 [Bhutan, Senegal, Lesotho, Rwanda] rank ahead of India and all of them are very small. India is corrupt, but most of the world is far more corrupt.
<br>Second, the author wonders how India can have religious violence when it is secular. Again, the assumption is that having a secular Constitution would magically bring about all the necessary security infrastructure such as a modern police force to contain riots. For the size of its population, India’s religious violence rate is quite low. And way lower than Pakistan. The status of Muslims in India is infinitely better than that of Hindus in Pakistan.
<br>Third, the author asks how the people can love their army in a democratic setup. I guess the author knows nothing of US. Democracy doesn’t mean you hate the military. In fact, being in a dangerous neighborhood with a key terrorism sponsor next to us, Indians are quite thankful that their army contains most of the bad stuff trying to get past our borders.
<br>All in all, a very poor article. India has its share of problems and is poor, given the circumstances of the past few hundred years. However, when it is compared to its non-democratic neighbors, India fares way better. While Indians might whine a lot about their politics, I don’t know of any who would trade their system for the one run in Pakistan or Myanmar.

Balaji Viswanathan: Why do you chant Sanskrit mantras when you don't understand them?
<html><body>
<br>Balaji Sir said in one of his answers about what new language would he like to learn, saying Sanskrit.
<br>One of the reasons sir gave was that he wanted to understand the meaning of the Sanskrit mantras which he chants.
<br>I also sang the English alphabet song in my kindergarten when I had no clue of what literature means and how language works.
<br>It is plain false that one should do only things after learning them perfectly. In fact, the only way to master things is by doing them and before you do something, you will not always have the perfect understanding of it.
<br>I have a tiny knowledge of Sanskrit that I studied in school with a fantastic teacher. Unlike in most schools, this teacher made us write original Sanskrit essays even when we were 12 years old. Through that I can understand a decent amount of Purusha Suktam and Vishnu Sahasranamam. But, there is a world of Samskrutam to be learned and mastered. And a world of Indian cultural heritage to be connected to.

Is it true that India failed in BRICS 2016?
<html><body>
<br>With no countries supporting India’s views, do you think that BRICS 2016 was a failure for India overall?
<br>How do you rate the outcome of BRICS 2016 compared to earlier ones?
<br>During my childhood days, I remember my friend getting scolded by his mom no matter how many marks he scored. His mom had an imaginary goal [of him winning a Olympiad] that could not be satisfied and no matter what he did, she came out disappointed.
<br>Even the Chinese state media had better appreciation for what India did [India used BRICS-BIMSTEC summit to outmanoeuvre Pakistan, Chinese media says ] than Indians with their imaginary goals. In contrast, Indian media pointlessly hyped the fact that the BRICS didn’t call out strong on Pakistan’s terrorism.
<br>A lot of Indians see these major summits with a single agenda and needlessly get disappointed when that imaginary agenda is not satisfied. These days it is all about the “condemn” drama. The discussion is about did X condemn about a recent terrorist attack. If they say we condemn, we lift our collars and if they don’t we throw tantrums. [Neither of these change anything on the ground].
<br>This is exactly what Pakistan wants, by the way. After every terrorist attack, India gets needlessly distracted with its broader foreign policy goals, spends needless cycles on getting some useless sympathy from the major powers, shows itself as a whiny, needy nation that needs global approval for its own issues etc. For a nation aspiring to be a superpower this weakness doesn’t behoove to be so obsessed about Pakistan [India May Have Over-Played Pakistan At BRICS Summit]. If Pakistan hit it, let it hit back with surgical strikes like it did. That gets global respect. But, this begging for global approval doesn’t it.
<br>What do they expect? That China abuse its protege in that stage with its rivals? That is not going to happen and it is unlikely for any world body to declare a major nuclear power as a terrorist nation. And such declarations [of Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan] etc have not brought down any level of violence. For a 1.3 billion nation, India has to move on and stop getting stuck on any particular issue.
<br>What India achieved in BRICS 2016?
<br>Let’s realize one thing. Pakistan would continue to sponsor terrorism for the forseeable future and no power is likely to do anything about it [it is not their problem]. Banning their cricketers and artists is not going to help neither does 3rd country support. Instead of losing our sanity over it and putting too much of our news cycles on it, let us continue to build our borders strong and nation strong. Let’s not define the success/failure of our foreign policy based on what someone has to say about Pakistan’s terror activities.

How does Balaji Viswanathan feel about being the most followed Quoran?
<html><body>
<br>Thanks for your wishes. It feels good, but it is not like a real accomplishment like a prize for research or writing. But, yes it brought a moment of smile. Happy to connect with the students on Quora.

If India is so good why do Indians leave India?
<html><body>
<br>Nationalistic Indians always fight for india online, they cant stop arguing how great is India. Well if it is so good, then why do you guys leave it? stay in your country.
<br>India has a net migration rate of zero [Central Intelligence Agency] That means the number of people going out is nearly the same as the number of people coming in. You can see both educated and uneducated labour moving in and out of India all the time. It is all balanced.
<br>That said, among the top rungs of Indian society there is often a hunger to explore the world and take on huge challenges. Thus, this group travels the world starting, working for and buying companies. Many in this group come back to India. There are few other groups that settle overseas, but their population is a round off error relative to India’s size.
<br>Again these small group of Indians move for the same reason people move out of their parents’ homes and native towns. It is not that you hate your parents or the home you lived. It is just that for your particular skillsets and ambitions differ, leading you to try out other things.

Can anyone write about the Kaveri water issue between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu?
<html><body>
<br>An unbiased, factual view, sans emotional ranting and jingoism, would be appreciated.
<br>Karnataka wants water. Tamil Nadu wants water. Karnataka government is lazy investing in efficient use of its water. Tamil Nadu government is lazy investing in efficient use of its water. Both states compete on how best they can waste water with improper irrigation and improper selection of crops.
<br>For both governments, it is quite convenient to blame the other side for their water shortage than doing something real to utilize the abundant rains that fall on both the states.
<br>For linguistic extremists on both sides, the water issue is a convenient excuse to bring their own aggressive muscle flexing. It is much easier to fly colorful flags and smash lorries than to actually do something useful to their language. Chest thumping is a good alternative to actually relishing the beauty of their poets.
<br>For the actors on both sides, the overall language+water mix is a convenient way to get back to relevance and public spotlight.
<br>For the thugs on both sides, this is a time to show their raw goonda power and extract concessions from major businesses - whether it be Kannadiga run businesses in Chennai or Tamil businesses in Bengaluru. Nothing is better for goonda business than to show business owners their whole depot with dozens of buses burning or their restaurants ransacked.
<br>On a normal day, public on both sides resent their politicians. But, light up the flame of linguistic passions fed with water, both sides suddenly see their own politicians as harbingers of righteousness and symbols of truth. The same governments that mismanage water and everything else become the trust worthy authorities on the subject of water.
<br>That in short is the issue of Kaveri. It is less about water and more about power.

How would you make INR 1 into $1?
<html><body>
<br>The simplest way is to rebase the currency.
<br>It changes nothing in the economy and will invite some derision from global economists, but can give satisfaction to some of the uber nationalists that their currency is “higher than” the mighty dollar.
<br>People assume the absolute value of a currency is somehow correlated with the strength of an economy. If that were the case, Japan must be significantly poorer than India and Kuwait must be way richer than Switzerland. As I mentioned above, any country can rebase their currency without changing anything in the economy.
<br>If currency value doesn’t matter, what matters? The only thing that matters to an economy in the long term is the productivity of the people - if an average Indian can produce more value of goods than an average non-Indian, the average Indian will be richer and Indian economy will be the richest. Thus, the only thing that matters is how we can get an average Indian to produce more and get better value.

Should India opt out of Indus Water Treaty? What will be its repercussions?
<html><body>
<br>Source: India Opting Out Of Indus Waters Treaty Would Be 'Act Of War', Says Pak's Sartaj Aziz
<br>It would be terrible for India to try to abrogate the Indus Water Treaty negotiated with much effort. That treaty between India and Pakistan stood through the worst of wars between the two countries - in 1965, 1971 and 1999.
<br>Mature countries like ours should keep the temptation of over-reacting. In both Pathankot and Uri our poor defense preparedness and the gaps in our border defense was on show. If four terrorists could kill a dozen armed soldiers in a supposedly well guarded base, it is a shame for us. Let’s fix that and make our country strong. Cutting water to millions of people for the fault of a rogue army of the neighbor and our own poor preparedness, is childish.

Why don't we find Gujarati people in the Indian Army?
<html><body>
<br>Gujaratis are less in the Indian Army for the same reasons that people from many major states were traditionally less represented in the Indian army [some of these are getting amended recently].
<br>Until the revolt of 1857 the Indian army was more of a representative of the general populace. After the revolution that bankrupted the world’s largest corporation, major changes occurred in the army and administration.
<br>One of the changes was the evolution of Martial race and Martial Races, Theory of - where the Raj identified minority groups that are known for the staunch loyalty and with less political involvement. They found the Sikhs, Gorkhas, Kumaonis, Pathans, Garwahlis and a few other groups in India’s edges right for this. The groups chosen were geographically, culturally and politically isolated from the majority population of India. Thus, began a massive transformation of the Indian army.
<br>When India got the independence, the political leaders of the Republic found this arrangement quite useful to sustain the democracy. By making sure that the army was drawn from the minority groups with little political power in the edges of India, they made India coup-proof. Thus, even if the Gorkhas, Sikhs, Garwahlis and Kumaonis of the Indian Army in theory could walk up to the Parliament and take over, there is little way for them to get the legitimacy of the majority & thus to rule. This is in contrast with Pakistan where Punjab controls both the political power and the army.
<br>By some careful planning & chance, it also happened that economic power of India shifted west, administrative power shifted south, military power shifted north, political power was in centre/east. Thus, to get India running a politician from UP would have to work with a civil servant of officer of Kerala, an army officer of Punjab and a businessman from Gujarat. Sort of four locks to keep India into one.
<br>Even though the Indian republic no longer does such discrimination in hiring, through network effects and public belief, majority people are in various regions continue to follow the professions of their regions. The lower unemployment of Gujarat [Indian states ranked by unemployment] also reduces the incentive to join the army.

Why are Indian police so corrupt? (There are few honest ones though)
<html><body>
<br>Please verify the fine charges for Bangalore, its better to pay fine than bribing
<br>http://mysorecitypolice.gov.in/c...
<br>A friend of mine had a conversation on this with me. He was complaining that the police were corrupt and always asking him bribes. I was surprised as I was never stopped randomly for bribes. When I asked him the reason, he told me that they asked him fines for not wearing a helmet and he never liked wearing a helmet!
<br>This is our problem. As public we often flout the law and then blame it on someone else. I was once driving at night and was stopped for a random breathalyzer test. In 5 seconds, the policeman tested and let me go. Since I was driving at 1am in the night [the flight got late] he had a reason to ask for that test. I was happy he was doing his job and moved on to my destination. And I was not stopped for anything else in the recent years.
<br>I’m not saying the policeman are all honest, upright individuals. But, they are not any more corrupt than you. Before complaining about the police, do a quick introspection in the mirror - are you following the rules correctly? If you are not wearing the right helmet, not wearing the seatbelt, not stopping at the signal, not carrying the correct insurance, you are the problem.
<br>Again, when you are caught for not wearing the helmet and pay Rs. 100 instead of the actual fine, you are not the victim of corruption, but the one corrupting the system.

What advice would you give to a 18 year old Indian regretting his decision of taking engineering?
<html><body>
<br>When we are young we tend to overestimate the importance of the choice of a particular branch/major. It really doesn’t matter what stream you take in college. What you study/don’t study in your class has not much impact over your life.
<br>Engineers can often go on to become managers, investment bankers, economists, politicians, actors, stock brokers, scientists, lawyers, entrepreneurs etc. You can study something in your college and become something else in your life.
<br>The half-hearted studying of a number of syllabus books doesn’t even give you 10% of skills required for the real jobs in the outside world. You have to pick up the rest 90% outside of the class and that 90% is completely up to you - not picked by your parents, teachers or friends. What you do in that 90% will actually decide your career path. This is how metallurgy engineers are able to become CEOs of software companies.
<br>What really matters in your college is:
<br>If you are defined by what you study in class, you become unidimensional and will be in for a life of underpaid jobs. Keep a hungry mind constantly absorbing ideas, moving with interesting folks, building interesting things and contributing great stuff to the society. That is what the future jobs will ask. Don’t keep regretting about pointless things.

What are the issues for Karnataka in sharing Cauvery water with Tamilnadu?
<html><body>
<br>Karnataka has the following arguments on the Cauvery issue:
<br>Tamil Nadu too has equally strong arguments making it tough for Supreme Court to clearly rule something that would make both parties happy. Neither side wants to hear the other’s side and think through just theirs. Again, it is much easier for the governments to blame the other side for their own water mismanagement. If the two governments seriously cared about the water and people, they would be strenuously cleaning up the lakes, desilting water bodies, go after illegal sand mafia wrecking the river beds, encourage water conserving crops and so on.

In terms of programmer quality, do you agree that China rank 1st globally while India ranks 31st?
<html><body>
<br>Which Country Has The Best Computer Programmers And Developers?
<br>Leave alone India. The land of Alan Turing, and a major center of tech R&D - UK is placed at 29, the land of Google, Apple and Microsoft - US is at 28 and Israel at 35. That alone should say something is wrong about the ranking rather than the countries ranked. Such poorly constructed reports without much context are more like trolling - built to get eyeballs with shock value rather than convey useful information. Of course, HackerRank benefits from that extra attention.
<br>Think about this: the countries that rank low are English speaking ones, while countries ranking up are all non-English speaking countries. What does that say?
<br>HackerRank is a coding site that mostly supports English and most of its users are from English speaking countries. In English speaking countries, a lot of people sign up to the website - whether they are great programmers or not. Some of them solve great challenges, while most are just casual browsers. The average user from these countries are not likely to finish all the challenges.
<br>In the non-English speaking countries, the only guys signing up are those at the elite level - the ones who have a good command of English and are well connected to even know about the website. These users are few in number [how many French and Swiss programmers are on HackerRank?] and are likely more committed than an average user. These elite users are also more likely to use HackerRank as a way to get a top job in US/UK, while those in major English speaking countries have other avenues to get job interviews.
<br>See Alexa ranking here: Hackerrank.com Traffic, Demographics and Competitors - more than half of the users are Indians and there are 17 times more Indians than Chinese. While the site ranks a respectable 484 in India, it is an also-ran in China at rank 11343. Does it mean Indians are far more interested in competitive programming than Chinese? That would be an equally faulty conclusion from this statistic.
<br>Given that the company is primarily India centric, there would also be pressure from investors to grow it outside, especially in large markets like China. Such “statistics” quoted in the question help it a bit in that direction.
<br>While the Chinese and Russian and French and Greek programmers might indeed be better than the Indian ones, this HackerRank statistics cannot be used to get any insight.

What can startups learn from Reliance Jio's aggressive pricing strategy?
<html><body>
<br>Free voice calling.
<br>Internet at INR50/GB (USD 1 per GB)
<br>The prices are lowest in the world.
<br>Airtel profit jumps 30.5%, Idea’s 60% on strong data revenue
<br>— Data drives growth for telecom firms
<br>For a country that seeks to be a leader in startup formation and ICT in general, India’s internet plans are outrageously backward. It is extremely expensive to buy data plans [even 1 GB of 4G data plans cost $5 or more in Airtel] and the existing players are too comfortable milking the data cow. There is a cartel like behavior with possible price fixing. We need some outside player to break the cartel. Reliance has the history of doing it.
<br>Reliance has the history of thinking outside the box and building strategies to bring the bottom of the pyramid in play. Left to themselves most large businesses in India lack imagination and the ability to push themselves. They settle for milking the proverbial cow. Think of how much change occured in mobile services in the past 8 years. Our phones have changed, but our services have not. This is why we need companies like Reliance to give a proverbial kick in the ass to our existing large businesses - who move like the tortoise and quick to put up the shield.
<br>In my father’s generation, Reliance thought out of the box when it came to the stock market and directly went to the public in stock issue. While the biggest traded companies of that time focused on a few rich investors, Reliance went to the bottom of the pyramid - looking for small investors and made them quite rich. They were one of the primary factors for the stock market revolution - bringing the common investors to the market. Master Move: How Dhirubhai Ambani turned the tables on the Kolkata bear cartel and 40 years ago... and now: Dhirubhai Ambani changed the idiom of doing business
<br>In my generation, when I was in college, Reliance thought out of the box in bringing the mobile phone revolution. Until Reliance came to the market, mobile phones were for the rich. There was a cartel-like group of business unable to imagine beyond the upper sections. Reliance set to revolutionise mobile services - For the first time Indian commoners could buy a mobile phone and thus started a massive boom.
<br>Now, in my son’s generation, Reliance is trying the same with data. Indian data plans are outrageously expensive. For its unreliability and limits, they should be a lot cheaper than they are. But, the telcos see that as a profit pot to cover their poorly run business units in lower end of the call business. Look at how they all increase prices together like in a cartel [Indian telecom operators increase data rates to balance spectrum splurge] and Data drives growth for telecom firms
<br>This has hampered data adoption and has kept most Indians in the dark days of the pre-Internet. To get fast data you have to be rich. Even the basic Internet access is extremely limited. See the world bank data. Internet users (per 100 people) India is at the bottom of Internet access.
<br>Internet is essential for us to bring people out of poverty and improve education/health access. However, those who control India’s data are too happy to charge heavily this basic access to cross subsidize their less profitable businesses.
<br>Now, the game is on in data. Just as what Reliance did to the stock market and the mobile voice services, they are breaking apart the cartel and outrageous prices charged by the existing companies. We can hope to see a rationalization of prices and that means not just the rich, but even the poor can move to fast Internet services - bringing our economy and HDI up.
<br>Their gumption and thinking out of the box is what making them unique. As entrepreneurs we can learn a lot from them.
<br>Besides that startups can now plan for a rapid increase in mobile data base and that is very exciting. We no longer have to depend just on the metros for our customers, but go beyond. Hopefully, data gets cheaper like in eastern Europe and east Asia.

When article 343 clearly states that Hindi shall be the official language of India, why some people are saying that India has no official language?
<html><body>
<br>Article 343:(1) The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script.
<br>Article 351: It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India .
<br>Government of India [Indian Union] has an official language. India doesn’t.
<br>What is the difference? Let’s take the example of Canada. The Canadian laws require or encourage all local governments & businesses to use English and French. Official bilingualism in Canada. Thus, the language is not just of the federal government, but also should be one used by almost everyone doing official business - government or private.
<br>In India, the central government should use Hindi/English in all its documents and boards [such as those associated with Railways, Army]. However, the central government cannot require other governments - say Chennai Corporation or private businesses - to use a particular language. This is a huge difference that many don’t realize. Languages with official status in India
<br>The states can set their own official languages. The Article 343 applies only to the Indian Union [Central government] and not all of India. This is why it mentions “official language of the union” and not “official language of the republic”. There is one related Article 348 [http://www.constitution.org/cons...] that makes the use of English mandatory for Supreme Court and High court proceedings.

What is so special about "Bengaluru" city?
<html><body>
<br>It predominantly has to do with the open mindedness of the city inhabitants. Bengaluru has been a more welcoming city to outsiders than almost any other city in India.
<br>It is not just the weather that is cool in Bangalore. It is a city where being weird is more tolerated than any other place in India. Once you accept weirdness, innovation happens. Same is true for San Francisco and many other startup hubs too.
<br>What other metros can learn from Bengaluru is the ability to switch on their real Bharatiyata. Remember, ancient India was so great because of its ability to be open to ideas and people from all directions, taking the best of what they have to offer while not giving up their core foundations.

Why are Indian PM Narendra Modi's comments on Balochistan such big news?
<html><body>
<br>Until now, India has never talked about Baluchistan whenever Indo-Pak issues were raised. Usually Pakistan brings up the topic of Kashmir, India goes defensive and the game goes on. India gets seen as a reluctant nation while Pakistan portrays itself as a nation open to talks and discussion. Unsuspecting foreign countries see Pakistan as the right party and push for a dialogue. In a bold move, India is signaling ways that could put not just Kashmir, but also Baluchistan in a possible future referendum.
<br>Most Indians don’t think about Baluchistan - the sparsely populated largest province of Pakistan. When they think, most don’t want to raise any trouble there. I have written many answers on why India should not interfere there. However, as Pakistan is mounting a new offensive on Kashmir, Indian public opinion is hardening. The belief is beginning to form that the way to solve Kashmir is not just through defense, but through straight offense and its winning applause even from the opposition party. Why Congress is backing PM Modi's bold strategy in Balochistan.
<br>In case of Kashmir, Pakistan has little to lose and hopes to gain a chunk of the valley, while India has something to lose. This gives Pakistan a really free hand in talking about the issue that India is so uncomfortable talking.
<br>Now, India is openly talking about an issue that Pakistan is uncomfortable talking. Here India has nothing to lose, while Pakistan has a lot at stake. Especially with the Chinese developing a deep water port there, Baluchistan is more important than ever. If Pakistan loses Baluchistan, it loses most of its coastline.
<br>It is likely based on the “Doval doctrine” of going on the offense. It worked great for the insurgents in the Northeast bringing down the violence of NSCN. While in the past, Nagaland has had hundreds of people dying from terrorism, this year that number is 5 - with no police/army casualty. Insurgency Related Killings in Nagaland
<br>In case of Kashmir, the offense cannot be merely at the terrorist groups, but its source itself, without going for a major war. If it is not mere talk and is a major policy shift, then it is likely that India would openly arm Baluchistan rebels. Pakistan has already been split once [creating Bangladesh] and India’s threat is not empty. Given the mounting evidence that India has on Pakistan’s role in recent disturbance in Kashmir, it is probably prudent for India to get on the offensive to bring peace.
<br>Until now it was the Indians who were offended by Pakistan’s statements and now Modi is putting the shoe on the other foot - Indian PM Modi's Balochistan comments upset Pakistan.
<br>Shift in the global game:
<br>It is a brilliant move. Either India could make Pakistan agree that neither country would interfere in another’s affair or go for a process where both countries lose a piece of their territory - with Pakistan losing far more than India.

Why doesn't India (which is an old civilization) have old universities like Oxford and Cambridge?
<html><body>
<br>The university at Taxila is over 2500 years old, 1500 years older than Oxford and Cambridge. Here is the remains of the ancient university.
<br>The university at Nalanda is over 1600 years old.
<br>The university at Pushpagiri is also over 1600 years old.
<br>It is quite possible that the ancient Indus Valley civilization had its own great learning centers - given its remarkable achievements and standardization - but we still don’t know enough about it.

Has India won any war against Pakistan?
<html><body>
<br>In my wanderings through Wikipedia, I keep seeing "Result: Tactical and strategic Indian victory" in articles about the wars between India and Pakistan. Is it true that Pakistan super scedes India in all out wars, whilst being multiple times smaller than India ? If yes then Why ?
<br>All 4 of them.
<br>Victory in a war is only decided by what each side wanted to achieve at the start of the war and what each achieved at the end of the war. In all the 4 wars, Pakistan fired the first shots and it was their initiative to lose. In each, India started reactive and by the end got better than their initial state.
<br>At the start of the 1947–48 war, Pakistan wanted to take over all of Kashmir. It ended up with only Kashmir’s fringes and hills. India didn’t think of Kashmir as much and only wanted to keep Kashmir’s options open. They ended up with all of the valley of Kashmir, including the capital as well as Jammu and Ladakh. Victory for India, Failure for Pakistan.
<br>At the start of the 1965 war, Pakistan wanted a mass people uprising in Kashmir after Sheikh Abdullah visited Pakistan in 1964. Pakistan also wanted to destabilize India that was already reeling under enormous problems including language agitations. At the end of the war, there was no people uprising in Kashmir and Pakistan ended up destabilizing itself. Mujibur pointed to how little the east was protected compared to the west, paving way for the later creation of Bangladesh.
<br>India on the other hand was praying nothing terrible should happen. Already wounded by China and stung by inflation, India wanted to avoid another failure. Anti-Hindi agitations of the south worried leaders of another partition. Indonesian threat on Andamans posted another headache. In the end, India not just avoided uprising in Kashmir & avoided losing Andamans, but also had a national integration with swelling of national pride. The wounds of China was forgotten with the tactical victories. Victory for India, failure for Pakistan.
<br>At the start of the 1971 war, Pakistan wanted to punish India for supporting the Bangla uprising. They had the superpower US and a variety of Islamic nations like Saudi Arabia behind them. India wanted to split Pakistan & teach it a lesson. In the end, India got what it wanted by equally splitting Pakistan. Massive defeat for Pakistan, ending with a massive surrender and loss of huge territory.
<br>At the start of the 1999 Kargil war, Pakistan wanted an uprising in Kashmir and bring global intervention in Kashmir at a time when Indian political leadership was shaky with coalition politics & intelligence too weak. With both nations going nuclear, it potentially could have brought direct UN intervention in the valley.
<br>In the end, what Pakistan got was a severe reprimanding by the US. Clinton brought Nawaz Sharif to Washington and got him a earful. India not just avoided any uprising, but also built meaningful relationship with both the US and Israel on the back of the war. Pakistan helped test India’s intelligence holes with only a small damage and India quickly built a range of measures. Defeat for Pakistan and a partial victory for India.
<br>You can see what happened in geopolitics. In 1948 Pakistan didn’t want global attention to Kashmir, but India got that anyway by taking it to UN. 50 years later, India didn’t want global intervention in Kashmir [changed circumstance] and once again India got what it wanted. In 1948, India would have been happy with a plebiscite or even settled for an independent Kashmir. By 1999, India’s position had improved substantially with these results that it no longer would settle for those options.
<br>You can also see what happened in politics. Losing countries have huge political upheaval. No Pakistani leader survived long after a war with India. After 1965 war, President Ayub Khan was reeling under pressure with allies like Zulfikar Bhutto quitting government. Bhutto eventually helped Ayub Khan lose power in a couple of years to Yahya Khan. In 1971, it was Yahya Khan’s turn to lose power. In 1999, it was Nawaz Sharif who lost power.
<br>In India’s case, leaders like Nehru, Shastri, Indira and Vajpayee had hero’s reception and all but Shastri successfully ruled years after their victory. Had it not been his untimely death from ill-health/conspiracy, Shastri would have ruled long after the war too.
<br>In summary:
<br>1947–48: India got most of Kashmir
<br>1965: Quelled the anti-Hindi agitations locally & rebuilt lost pride from China war
<br>1971: India tore apart Pakistan to create Bangladesh
<br>1999: India rebuilt strong relationship with the west and Israel.
<br>In the end, India won every time. Pakistan lost most of Kashmir and all of East Pakistan. I’m astonished how Pakistanis think this is a victory. If this is victory, what is defeat? India, on the other hand, used the Pakistan’s wars to not only hold on to most of Kashmir, but also for national integration especially during the worrying phase of the 1965 anti-Hindi agitations, just before the war.

December 2015: Modi walks away while the national anthem was being played in Moscow. Why aren't BJP supporters questioning his nationalism now?
<html><body>
<br>Big embarrassment! PM Modi walks as National Anthem plays in Russia
<br>RSS and Modi supporters are always on their toes to question others' nationalism, including that of our Honorable Vice President, in such cases. Why are they silent now?
<br>Much ado about nothing.
<br>Here is what the video shows. A dazed Prime Minister walking out of a flight in the middle of the night with a huge background noise from the flight engines. Amidst that noise and confusion, an aide directs the Prime Minister to walk in a direction and the PM walks in that direction. Someone realizes that the PM overshot the spot he was supposed to stand. In 2 seconds it was corrected and he comes to the correct spot.
<br>For all those judging, try flying twice a week, sleeping 4 hours a day and get out in a din and never be confused for 1 second. Maybe you are assuming Modi to be a god, but he is not.
<br>Insulting a nation would be, if the Prime Minister continued to walk even after pointed to the mistake. That didn’t happen. To err is human, to not rectify or to do it deliberately would be criminal. Walking two extra steps is no mistake.
<br>I’m so “mindblown” by the silliness here.

What difference will GST Bill make now?
<html><body>
<br>It will decreases the living cost or one can say luxary cost but major drawback is that food becomes costly. Earlier we can manage without luxurious things but now we can't live without food. At least this one should have to keep separate from GST.
<br>India is finally getting the GST - a historic once in a generation revamp of systems. It reduces the massive heterogeneity of how different states tax products and services, and streamline tax compliance, which in turn can lead to less corruption and more development.
<br>India is one of the hardest places in the world to do business. Indian entrepreneurs would rather buy/start businesses in distant places like San Francisco, London or Singapore, rather than in India with much larger markets, much cheaper labor and much more familiarity. If you want to be honest, life becomes exceptionally hard.
<br>Goods & Services Taxes law will now reduce that difficulty a bit, and thus will help more entrepreneurship and bring more people out of poverty. Again, it is not a magic wand, but can be one brick in the overall rebuilding of India.
<br>Many businesses see India as a the land where they die by confusion. There are a slew of taxes [VAT, local sales tax, central sales tax, service tax, octroi, cess, excise] that makes it very hard to move goods & do business. Since it is very hard to follow rules, most companies take shortcuts, leading to more corruption. It is not like these entrepreneurs and their employees are evil [most are good in their private lives], but see there is no way to get job done the straight way.
<br>The first act to reduce corruption is to make it easy to follow rules. If the rule following becomes easy and painless more will be following the rules and there will be less corruption and more development.
<br>Let us try to have one tax - very transparent to understand, very easy to comply, very easy to pay and impossible to avoid. That can help India get strong. If you are happy and you know it, clap your hands ;-)

How was Balaji Viswanathan's experience in IIT Bombay?
<html><body>
<br>He came to to IITB in the last week of July ’16 and took 2–3 sessions, including a session where he shared his ideas for India (If someone has a link for the same, please share it). I wanted to know how was Balaji’s experience with the IIT Bombay.
<br>I had a fantastic time at IIT Bombay and had the opportunity to connect with a lot of students. The Finance Club at IIT Bombay was organizing the events and the organizers like Shrenik Jain did a great job.
<br>They organized three sessions for me - the first one was a mix of History, Finance, Economics and Technology, on how countries rise from the bottom and what lessons India can learn from. Here is the slide deck. Ideas for India: Building India's future
<br>Nearly 300 students attended that session and we had a good Q&A session at the end. Overall, it was 4 hours of fun [for me, at least].
<br>The second was a workshop on career development. I talked about the various career paths and their challenges. I didn’t prepare any slides for that and overall I was not impressed with my session. It was attended by over 150 people, but I had not built enough excitement with the audience there.
<br>The third was an interactive session on building ideas for India. This was my most favorite session. We had about 30 participants brainstorming ideas. Someone started on the path of waste management and soon we had 20 different startup ideas on just waste management.
<br>Some of the ideas from that event:
<br>I was overall thrilled. Expect to do more such events. Some of the upcoming meetups/talks: Upcoming Quora meetups/talks at the ancient centers of Bharat.

Does Balaji Vishwanathan believe that, Mahabharata and Ramayana really happened?
<html><body>
<br>Yes. Even if it is not in the form we know of. Archaeological Survey of India did a number of excavations and their findings are somewhat consistent with the Sanskrit texts. The head of those excavations in Hastinapur and others was B. B. Lal who later became ASI’s director. Mahabharat sites continue to have the same names even today: B. B. Lal
<br>You can read more in the ASI’s website: Excavation Sites in Uttar Pradesh
<br>The physical evidence is matching up with the literary evidence in many places. For instance, ASI found that there was a massive flood around 975 BCE that destroyed Hastinapur (Experts dig up 950BC as epic war date) and the same is referred in the later texts. The dating though is highly disputed by other historians some of whom talk about an earlier date. ASI also recently found evidence for the Indraprastha - The discovery of Indraprastha which is probably 4000 years old.
<br>Most reputed historians on India, just John Keay believe that these depict real events, even if some fiction was mixed later. Michael Wood in his popular documentary on the story of India also mentions the same. Like in most of ancient history, we have way too many gaps in our understanding requiring some assumptions.
<br>Thus, if one is not biased, should be able to see Mahabharata as based on real events. Ramayana’s physical evidence is not found as much and it is hard for many of these artifacts to survive given that it is a densely populated region in a very humid part of the world and people have been constantly building on top of the existing structures. For instance, the excavation of the Babri Masjid shows plenty of old structures of Hindu, Jain and other origins. ASI excavated more questions than answers in Ayodhya
<br>We have a lot to learn about India, but given the pace of findings we have had in the past 100 years, we could learn a lot more too in the next few decades. We just need a government who can invest more in such excavations.

Was Atal Bihari Vajpayee more popular than today's Modi?
<html><body>
<br>If Vajpayee was the Gavaskar of Indian politics, Modi is like Virat Kohli. Gavaskar was refined, suave and solid, but also slow and less exciting. Kohli is aggressive and impatient [leading to trouble at the test level], but very exciting to watch.
<br>Vajpayee started his term great - with the historic Pokhran nuclear test within weeks of starting office. He had his down in unable to prevent Kargil intrusion, but was later redeemed with a great victory there. He took India through some tough times such as the fallout of the financial crisis in Asia, attack of the Parliament, takover of Afghanistan by the Talibans [leading to the hijack of an Indian Airline flight], fallout of the dotcom crisis in the US and so on.
<br>By the end of his term in 2004, India was way ahead of where it was in 1998. There was less uncertainty about India’s growth and the markets were roaring - Sensex at nearly 3 times the levels of 1999.
<br>Modi, like Kohli, is new in his career and it is too soon to judge. He has had some explosive innings, but has not been tested long like Vajpayee. While Gavaskar had to face the dreaded pace quartet in West Indies wearing no helmets, Kohli has to deal with far less threatening bowlers with far more protection. In the same way, Modi’s India is facing far less threats and challenges compared to Vajpayee’s India.
<br>However, the question was not who is better. In terms of popularity it is a non-contest. Modi is way more popular than Vajpayee ever was. Not just in social media. As a proof, Modi could single handedly deliver BJP its largest ever seats in Lok Sabha, while Vajpayee had to play a complex coalition dance to scrape with a simple majority. Vajpayee was not drawing anywhere near the crowds of Modi when he travelled abroad.

Why is it important to protect endangered species?
<html><body>
<br>In 1995, about 14 wolves were released in the Yellowstone National Park. The wolves were extinct from that region for nearly 70 years. Within a decade of them getting back, dramatically positive things happened. Deers began to change their grazing pattern and in the parts of the park where they overgrazed and now avoided, regenerated plant life. This in turn contributed to less erosion and made rivers more healthy. The cascaded effect of all these form one of the remarkable stories of what these wild animals can do.
<br>A dozen wolves changed the park so positively [even though wolves are not the only agent of change in the Yellowstone’s restoration]. And the opposite works too - the absence of these endangered species will do all the reverse things.
<br>We humans need these endangered species to survive for our own reasons. Because, these are the nuts and bolts of our planet. As these nuts get loose and fall apart, the whole bio structure of our beautiful planet falls apart.
</body></html>
Should India be separated from "Asia" and categorized as their own?
<html><body>
<br>Yes, there is no point in counting India in Asia either through culture, geography, history or ethnicity.
<br>India sits in its own continental plate and has a distinct culture. It has not ruled East Asia nor ruled by it. It is larger than Europe in population and it is plain Euro-centrism to see Europe as distinct from Asia [when they are a part of the same continental plate], but India as a part of Asia. India would satisfy every criteria to be a continent - large population [larger than other continents], separate continental plate, distinct cultural & linguistic groups and so on.
<br>Source: NASA. The Indian Plate.
<br>The Americans are often using the correct terminology by calling out the Asians, Indians and the Arabs distinctly [all of these are separate plates and separate cultural groups]. In UK, also this distinction is more common. I guess it is just a matter of being exposed to more of outside world.

What was it like to grow up in India in the 1990s?
<html><body>
<br>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us —
<br>—- Charles Dickens [A Tale of Two Cities]
<br>The 1990s was the age of sensation in India and fit with Dickens description. The period from 1992–94 was especially breathtaking. It was a time icons were made. It was the time India was made. It was also a time India faced massive threats [Babri Masjid and its fall out, Mumbai blasts, plague scare, Harshad Mehta, Kashmir terrorism, collapse of USSR, Gulf war].
<br>Think of Sachin Tendulkar, Aishwarya Rai, AR Rahman - all those national brands were created in that decade. Growing up in 1990s meant having a front row to watching those icons created in real time. It was the delight of seeing Sachin score his first few centuries LIVE.
<br>There have been so many cricketers in India’s sporting history - Gavaskar, Vengsarkar, Pataudi - but none captured the imagination of masses like Sachin Tendulkar. Go to any part of India, you would find a Sachin Tendulkar imagery. Poor, rich, religious, irreligious, urban, rural, north, south - all those differences vanish in Sachin’s fandom.
<br>I remember coming home from school with excitement to watch Sachin’s first centuries - in the autumn of 1994. There was nothing as joyful in those boyhood times as watching Sachin score a century. Even by his first century he was a national sensation. In 1996, he would be joined by two more icons - Ganguly and Dravid. We would have bets on who would finally beat Desmond Haynes who had an insurmountable 17 ODI centuries.
<br>There have been many great musicians. However, almost all of them were local brands. Ilayaraja was superb, but known only to the Tamils. Then came AR Rahman - a national brand who made India sing to the same tune. Roja was a sensation. In theaters, the flag burning scene always had a standing ovation. Indians started gelling far better.
<br>There have been so many Miss Worlds and Miss Universes. No one else could create the sensation like Aishwarya Rai did. It was as though sheer beauty India’s differences. She was a sensation well before the victory [remember those Pepsi ads]. I remember my close friend in 6th standard agonizing over Rai losing Miss India to Sushmita Sen.
<br>Harshad Mehta and his buddies had made stock markets really attractive. We lived in Delhi in a housing project for “lower income” people, but most of those aunties would busily chat about Reliance and Dabur shares. I was in 6th standard when I could go through every stock IPO and help my father by Oriental Bank of Commerce IPO. We were flipping stocks like crazy.
<br>I remember when Coca Cola was allowed to come into India in 1993. My dad took me to the shop to buy a chilled bottle of iconic Coke and told me something along the lines of “this is how freedom tastes like”. The sugar was taking Indians to a high. I remember holding my first bottle of Coke - that brilliantly designed glass bottle and still can’t believe how much that stupid sugar water is so addictive.
<br>Manmohan Singh made budgets a sexy affair. I remember my parents, uncles and other adults glued to the television like a world cup final. Cricket itself became sexy in the 1990s - Sharjah, Hero Cup and the various innovations from Packer in Australia made the sleepy sport sensational.
<br>TV became very sexy. In a very short time in early 1990s we got whole of world channels piped into our home and it was a shock after watching the staid state owned Doordarshan. The blatant nudity of HBO movies & FTV was a massive shock to Indians corrupted by Victorian era morals. They reacted as though they never seen nudity in temple walls.
<br>We collected Big Fun chewing wrappers and the idea was that the runs in those wrappers amounted to something. We bought trump cards [especially WWF ones and I always wanted Undertaker card when he was Rank 3] and played like maniacs. My principal once seized my pack and my friends theorized that maybe he didn’t want to buy one for his son ;-)
<br>Besides watching WWF [later WWE] we watched lots of Cartoon Network once we came home from school [it is not like you could watch cartoons on phones back then]. On DD there was the Superhit Muqabla [sort of like MTV billboard] with random albums by Baba Sehgal, Alisha Chinai etc besides Bollywood songs. The tour of Michael Jackson in 1996 was also a massive sensation. My dad was a big fan of MJ but even the live telecast at the Chennai beach was expensive.
<br>In a very short time we went from this:
<br>to this:
<br>By mid 1990s we had the Internet. I remember the iconic reception Bill Gates got in India to launch Windows 95. Even the regional magazines were full of things about Bill Gates [maybe Microsoft PR did a lot of spending]. Internet was a rage in the late 1990s. A school teacher of mine started teaching Java. One month he taught and next month he was gone. Some company in California vacuumed him paying 50 times the salary he got as a school teacher at my school. People joked that they would call their BCom degrees as B[dot]com.
<br>I was reading about Internet for a long time and in 1998 I finally got to browse my first page. It was crazy expensive - Rs. 60 for 1 hour of browsing [that is like Rs 300 now]. I had 10 rupees and a super slow modem, thus had only enough time to create my first email account that I use to this day. The next two years, as the prices crashed my school friends and I would spend a lot of time on the Internet [while we would start researching search engines and science projects eventually we would end up asking ASL to random strangers on Yahoo chatrooms that we hoped to be someone hot].
<br>I bought my first domain name in 11th standard, but didn’t realize those addresses are not permanent. Plenty of my pages over time ended up in the trash bin. It was an age of optimism.
<br>The early 1990s manic action gave way to a brutal hangover in 1995–96. Narasimha Rao completely lost it and was mired in huge scams. He was not born to be a revolutionary and could not get comfortable in his new shoes. Unlike in the case of Deng Xiaoping in China, his revolution was less planned and accidental. The iconic Agni missiles were sent to cold storage and the economic reforms were gone. Markets crashed and real estate prices went through a long fall.
<br>By 1996 all we could hear was bad news. Taliban was taking over Afghanistan and we would get horror news from them. In 1997, South East Asia went through a massive market crash. As Pakistan started testing increasingly large ranges of missiles they bought from North Korea, there was a fear of a nuclear war. There was ethnic cleansing of Pandits in Kashmir valley and there was a massive indecision in governance.
<br>In 1995, we went to J&K for pilgrimage and I remember fearing terrorist attacks anytime. It was a time when terrorists would bomb at will and kidnap tourists. In 2–3 years they removed all western tourists from those idyllic hills. At the same time, the Punjab terrorism was in wane. We went to Ludhiana to have a large glass of Lassi as though to celebrate that end.
<br>While the early 1990s was a renaissance of the southern cinema with the rise of Manirathnam, Rahman, Shankar etc, in Bollywood it was a fall. The Kapoor/Bhachhan era gave way to the Khans and in the early days they were acting out cheesy romantic flicks with super long names - KKHH, DDLJ, HAHK...
<br>With Hindi industry making such flicks, India’s oscar nominations in that decade were primarily dominated by Tamil - Anjali (1990), Thevar Magan (1992), Kuruthipunal (1995), Indian (1996), Jeans (1998) and Hey Ram (2000). [Since then no Tamil movie got the honour]. List of Indian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film
<br>Quality Hindi movies became rare in 1990s and that came at the turn of the millennium with Lagaan - when the Khans moved to more serious stories. If 1990s Bollywood has to be summarized it is that “Boy loved girl. Then girl loved boy. They all danced”.
<br>In late 1990s there was the Y2K scare and many serious people thought that the world would come to an end when the nuclear missiles would go berserk as they move from 99 to 00 [oh those crazy fears and conspiracies].
<br>Overall, the 1990s packed action, fear and excitement. It was like being in a theme park.

China did not let India to be part of NSG then why India can't ban the Chinese products in India?
<html><body>
<br>We understand that INDIA is a part of WTO (and China too). If China can ban one of the Apple product just because it looks same as Chinese product. Then why can’t we ban Chinese products as most of the Chinese products are copy of other big brands ?
<br>That will be silly and immature. Let’s say you play a game of Cricket and you are not given a batting chance. Would you pick your bat & stumps and go home? Would that be a sign of maturity? While you should fight for your batting chance and stand up to bullying, you should also learn to work in a team & not run away from it.
<br>Indian leadership is a fairly matured one and thus doesn’t play stupid mind games. It will continue to work with China & other countries, while pushing for its rights. India wants to be a leader and an essential part of leadership is dealing with disappointments & not getting the stuff they wanted.

How have Indians managed to escape the strong anti immigrant stance in the west so far?
<html><body>
<br>Indians have not really escaped anti-immigration protests in the West. In fact, in many parts of the west, Indian knowledge workers face a stronger bias than their peers from any country with a favorable political relationship with the west.
<br>A while ago there was this Kinder Statt Inder [Children, not Indians] slogan from Germany to campaign against the Indian tech workers [as a side note, Germans used to be far more negative on India than any other country in the world, including Pakistan: Anti-Indian sentiment and http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/media...]. The immigration scenario improved in Germany a bit in 2013 reforms [Germany downs immigration wall for non-EU skilled workers], but a long way to go. In the US, Indians are always singled out when it comes to any debate on the H1b visas.
<br>Knowledge workers in the West constantly rile against the Indians in most online forums. Indians take the longest to get the permanent residency [Green Card] in the US [Why does the US discriminate against immigrants from big countries?] and Indian students also find it the hardest to get admission into top universities [for comparable skillsets to a person from a smaller country].
<br>You can see the views on India [http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/media...] and can find that mainland Europe can be far more negative on India than China or Pakistan.
<br>India is a democracy, it doesn’t export terrorism, it doesn’t fight the west, it has very little outflow of refugees/illegal immigrations, it doesn’t have street protests against the west, and despite all that India finds itself as a punching bag for many anti-immigration protestors. There is little excuse for these attitudes against India. Most of these are from racial stereotypes of viewing India as a land of snake charmers.
</body></html>
Why doesn’t India hold referendums for highly important issues like the Brits?
<html><body>
<br>The Brexit has shown that masses are stupid when it comes to making policy decisions and this is exactly why Indian system doesn’t allow referendums. One can also learn from the Californians on how to bankrupt a state with referendums & propositions.
<br>People often confuse a democracy with an Ochlocracy. Democracy doesn’t mean people having the right to decide in all policy decisions. Not always; not necessarily. In the Athenian democracy, political officials were selected through a random lottery in a process called Sortition and this sort of democracy was also used in places like India [The writing on the wall]. In fact, many researchers believe that democracies can work better by taking away masses’ ability to vote, but instead selecting leaders through a lottery [How Selecting Voters Randomly Can Lead to Better Elections].
<br>In the past we also had things like mob justice - where people will catch hold of a criminal and collectively decide the punishment. It didn’t go well. Eventually, we decided to have a collection of courts and selected people [judges] to manage the trial. Mobs cannot be trusted to be rational as they often went berserk on innocent people they suspected.
<br>The strength of a democracy is not from its voting processes, but in its ability to bring diverse interests to discuss about a society’s future. That is the strength of a democratic system - the ability to hear diverse voices and not the ability of masses to select the best. This is why random selection can work as good as allowing people to vote for their leaders. Both typically ensures a diverse selection.
<br>Masses are prone to emotions and a crowd is always more irrational than an individual. In fact, this problem with democracies have been studied by the US founding fathers and they came with a system that balances the people’s right to have a say in ruling with checks on their emotional outbursts. India’s founding fathers have learned many of those & implemented a lot of those ideas.
<br>Masses are a little better at selecting leaders and they should be provided that option. But, here is what Indian Republic does to reduce the stupidity of masses:
<br>All of these are there to protect the masses from themselves. Would you have a system where the laws you follow are decided by Facebook likes, shares and retweets? That would be dystopia. Modern democracies are not the rule of mobs and many have outdated definitions of democracy. As I look at every referendum in Europe, I’m so glad that India doesn’t have such a system.

Why does India use 220 volts when the USA uses 110 volts?
<html><body>
<br>Like most things in the US, the 110V AC is the result of a supercharged political clash and an ugly compromise. [See more: War of Currents]
<br>US has always had a pair of highly electric innovators who fought to make their creation the standard [Edison vs Tesla, Jobs vs Gates, Wright vs Curtiss, Hearst vs Pulitzer, Colt vs Wesson].
<br>Tesla promoted the Alternating Current and he was backed by Westinghouse. Edison promoted the Direct Current and he was the powerhouse behind the company that later became GE [after kicking out Edison & his name]. Edison delivered power at 110 V as the early use was primarily illumination that didn’t require a lot of power.
<br>Edison created a number of high pitched drama to prove that Tesla’s AC was dangerous. He got the society really scared of high voltage AC. Eventually there was a compromise where the US system adopted the Tesla’s Alternating Current but with Edison’s Voltage [110V].
<br>In the meanwhile, the Germans had little of that melodrama and none of the breakneck competition & compromise. With a monopoly over electricity production they objectively chose a much better standard, delivering Alternating Current at the more efficient 220V. The German standard became the European standard and eventually the world standard. India follows the standard just like the rest of the world.
<br>In the meanwhile, countries that are connected to the United States [most of the Americas other than Brazil] are stuck with Edison’s 110V.

Why is Raghuram Rajan stepping down as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India after only one term?
<html><body>
<br>Bloomberg: Rajan Stepping Down
<br>Rajan didn’t step down. He was pushed out in one of the most unfortunate decisions of the Modi administration. There are a lot of similarities with how Abdul Kalam was denied a second term as the President by Sonia Gandhi. In both cases, you had an amazing individual who had the energy, reputation and the will to stand up to the government. The political heads hate such a challenge.
<br>Unlike the past RBI governors who were given 5 year terms, Rajan was only given a 3 year term by the previous government and the present government used that chance to deny him a second term [for the same reason that the previous government gave him such a short term]. I will give you some background.
<br>There were sparks publicly flying between RBI and the government for a while and this end result was probably not a total surprise. RBI and the government are two opposite forces [sort of like developers and testers in a software team] who work to build the economy.
<br>The government has the control of the “fiscal policy” - dealing with matters like spending and taxing. The reserve bank has the control of the “monetary policy” - dealing with matters like interest rates and bank loans. Governments would typically love to spend/invest a lot to grow the economy, while the RBI would love to have the government spend less & maintain a low inflation [more government spending equals more inflation].
<br>In short, the government is the accelerator and the Reserve Bank is the brake.
<br>If you don’t press the accelerator, you won’t get anywhere. If you don’t press the brake, you will get somewhere [not necessarily alive]. There is a healthy conflict between the two.
<br>While there were tensions even in the past, they were quite less. The RBI governors are usually mellowed men [in a land of many women bankers, they never get picked to head the RBI] who are honest and smart, but will quickly back down from a conflict. They are typically old too - sort of like the Presidents - chosen carefully to not have too much energy.
<br>Rajan is among the youngest RBI governors and is a live wire. He has an international reputation no other RBI governor ever had. Within his 40s, he has seen some of the world’s best economics related posts - including being the youngest Chief Economist of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) . He doesn’t require a job. India required him.
<br>Rajan was an energetic drill sergeant who makes you sweat and nobody likes to sweat. He was brought in as a desperate move in the last days of the Manmohan Singh government which lost all its credibility and needed something to restore India’s credibility in the financial markets.
<br>As India’s economic prospects improved with Modi’s arrival [and with a healthy dose of Rajan’s policies] the desperation of politicians went away. The tough medicine started to taste bitter as the emergency passed. They believe Rajan is applying the brakes even after the calamity has passed and you have a free road ahead of you. Rajan believes that he needs to keep off the sugar so that the government can snack on a healthy diet.
<br>Unlike the previous RBI governors, Rajan also made a few political statements that unlike how the media reported, were not that controversial. However, like the President, the RBI governor is expected to stay away from politics and not make any statements unrelated to their job.
<br>These two things cost his job. a) He was an inflation hawk whom the government and business community accuse as pressing the brakes too much. b) He had too much energy and independent thinking.
<br>The question is not just one of Rajan or inflation or interest rates. It is about a system where the heads of key institutions are not expected to stay independent. This political meddling has been there since the start [from the times of Nehru]. We always elect old, unambitious, insipid, uncontroversial leaders for our top posts because the top politicians are scared of ambition, energy and independence. In the rare times these get selected, the politicians push them out sooner or later.
<br>Even if the government doesn’t like their ideas or policies, it has to work with them - because our system is only as strong as its institutions. The government has to change its mind and bring back Rajan.

Should the Indian passport be redesigned?
<html><body>
<br>IT looks excessively dull.
<br>UPDATE1: Some people have misunderstood the question. I’m not only talking about the design of the passport but the internal security features and other details which are missing.
<br>UPDATE2: I have logged a petition Ministry of External Affairs: Redesign the Indian Passport
<br>Of course. Indian passport is among the most boringly designed passports out there. It is designed by bureaucrats than artists. For such a colorful nation of brilliant variety, our passport is monotonous. Here is the interior of an Indian passport. It has nothing.
<br>Now, here is the interior of an American passport. It has brilliant quotes and great many specialities of the land.
<br>I say we make it 72 pages with each state & union territory given a 2-page spread, - the best wonder from that state could be used as the background image and some great quote from a literature of that region used as the text. The passport could be a passport for Indians to look into India - to take pride, joy and enlightenment.
<br>Let’s make it modern; let’s make it colourful; let’s make it secure; let’s make it big and let’s make it really worthy to bear the Bharata name.

India: Why do most rich Indians have a lighter skin tone than relatively poor Indians?

<br>I’m an American, I was visiting last month and I made this observation. Why so? No, it was not makeup. I can tell you that. I am aware of the North-South thing. But still…
<br>Skin tan [or its absence] is sometimes a function of prosperity. In cold countries, a tan is an indicator of prosperity as it implies that the person has the resources to holiday in tropical beaches.
<br>In warm countries, the absence of tan is an indicator of prosperity as that implies that the person could afford to work in shade [instead of hawking on the streets], eat more dairy products etc.
<br>There is a correlation between being rich and being light skinned in India:
<br>In fact, across Asia you can see the correlation between prosperity and fairer skins due to the same factors. Even in Thailand, Japan and China, being darker is often perceived as being poor. Of course, some correlation doesn’t imply 1.0 direct correlation - and there are scores of rich people with dark skin & vice versa.
<br>Since people want to appear rich and get very high incentives that go along with it, they often cheat their way too. The tanning salons in the cold countries and the fairness creams in the warm countries both are ways to cheat the tanning game.

What's the significance of the new deal between India & Iran to jointly develop the port of Chabahar?
<html><body>
<br>India and Iran agree port deal, reviving trade ties
<br>Does this represent some sort of big step in Indo-Iranian ties, or is it more of an incremental one? And what’s the potential impact on the region (AFG, PAK, Gulf states)?
<br>It is probably one of the masterstrokes of Modi and even the staunchest anti-Modi media are singing praises of it. India’s $500 million port deal with Iran is a masterstroke—and a tough balancing act
<br>It is not new and has been in the works for a long time and has been finally greenlighted by the United States [US backs India-Iran Chabahar port deal despite residual suspicion over Tehran].
<br>In one stroke, it does the following for India:

Ideally, where should India's capital be re-located?
<html><body>
<br>No great Indian emperor has ever had Delhi as his capital. Not Chandragupta Maurya. Not Ashoka or Samudragupta. Not Kanishka, Akbar, Sivaji, Raja Raja, Pulikesi and the great names of Indian history. It was capital of either an outsider who was yet to understand the country [such as various Delhi Sultanates] or of kings who were kicked out from elsewhere [say the Pandavs].
<br>India is unique (bizarre?) among the major countries with a capital that is so far from its ports. As I detail it here: Geographically, what are advantages and disadvantages of having Delhi as Capital of India? such a choice has had serious outcomes in India’s policymaking - especially in matters of economics and commerce.
<br>As the Mahabharata legend goes, the Pandavas built Indraprasta only because they were kicked out of empire’s capital of Hastinapur. As soon as they won the war, they were back to their capital at Hastinapur, abandoning Indraprasta. This was the case for most of its kings - who were quite eager to abandon Delhi for another capital.
<br>Among the few regional kings who really had Delhi as their capital, they were constantly looking for a move once they realized the city’s limitations. Delhi was a revolving door of new settlements built only to be abandoned or destroyed in a generation. Sometimes these moves - such as the Tughluq’s unlucky move into Daulatabad didn’t pan out due to bad water resources & forcible movements. You can see this in the numerous transitions and abandonments the city has faced. History of Delhi
<br>Even Aurangzeb who had his nominal capital there mostly operated from the Deccan. Delhi was selected in 1911 as India’s new capital not with a growth motive, but to primarily kill the nationalism movement that was taking over India’s then capital of Kolkata.
<br>We can learn from history. I would build it near the Paradip port in Odisha and since childhood I have dreamed that location to be my ideal city [more details: How would you design a perfect new city from scratch?]
<br>
<br>The only issue is the annual cyclones and the destruction is mostly man-made. If we can restore some of the mangroves, while also build better concrete structures we would be able to withstand them just like how other great cities withstand hurricane winds and storms.
<br>Why not Visakhapatnam?
<br>Why not Bhopal, Nagpur…?
<br>No ports. No major water sources. A capital should not be in the middle of nowhere.
<br>EDIT: One interesting thing I noted about the comments here is how much a fear of water exists among Indian users.

What were ordinary people doing when India and Pakistan were busy fighting Kargil war in 1999?
<html><body>
<br>The war lasted several months.
<br>There was a massive wave of patriotism. It was the first war after the introduction of TV & Internet and it was the first war after both nations acquired nuclear weapons. It was thus very tense. There were huge fund raising events for the injured jawans and there was that rare unity that was absent throughout the tumultuous 1990s.
<br>When the news first broke out that Indian army has started engaging intruders in the Kargil sector, I was traveling cross country between Kolkata and Chennai. Some in the train were tense, while the others were more engrossed in the cricket world cup. Only in the following few weeks did the seriousness of it all sink in.
<br>One of the interesting things the Indian government did was to block Dawn and other Pakistani newspapers from coming through Indian ISPs. I had never heard of them before and only with the visibility provided by the government ban did I start reading them.
<br>The most epic portion of the Kargil war was the capture of the Tiger hills that captured public imagination across the nation. Battle of Tiger Hill. When the Indian Army recaptured the hill on July 4 [coincidentally the American independence day], pictures began floating all over the Internet - photoshopping the American victory in Iwo Jima with the Indian flag.
<br>Later, the actual image of Tiger hills recapture became epic enough. A year later when I joined college these images became part of the notebook cover page of the notebooks we got in college.
<br>While there was a lot of news watching, I don’t think anyone stocked a lot of essential supplies in preparation of a nuclear winter. There were no emergency preparation drills either.
<br>Overall, it was akin to a long cricket series running for 3 months that brought a lot of patriotism, excitement, but very little of preparedness. It was like an extended World Cup and people were glad that the Jawans could compensate for the abject failure of Azharuddin’s men in England.
<br>When the war was over, Indians gave a thumping victory to the BJP [first time a non-Congress led coalition won a majority and lasted the entire term] in the general elections and brought the political stability that was lacking for nearly 2 decades. Indian stock markets and business conditions dramatically improved in the months following the war.

Why don’t people name their son "Balaji" anymore?
<html><body>
<br>The current trend in India is that Hindu boys are predominantly named with words starting with A. Among my nephews/neices we have Aditya (2), Aditi, Adrith, Aarav, Akhil and so on and my own son's name starts with A - Arjun. [I just joke that new parents run through the list of baby names, and get overwhelmed before they cross A].
<br>Names starting with B are completely out of fashion - for boys and girls. Balaji was an outdated name even when I was a child [my dad planned a lot of names from ancient Indian history, before my grandpa used some numerology calculations to choose this]. My dad consoled me that I will not be just a Balaji, but a Vishwanath will be added after the famed Peshwa king.
<br>My only other consolation is that by sheer coincidence my wife is named Mahalakshmi and these are the names of a famous divine couple [Balaji-Mahalakshmi] who are considered extremely holy and extremely rich too [whose names are invoked in a lot of our holy ceremonies]. That makes me feel less bad. Being rich and holy, Balaji or Mahalakshmi are used very commonly to name shops in Chennai.
<br>As of 2016, names like Balaji are considered both trite and uncool. It doesn't mean anything awesome either [bala just means boy and as though a consolation a respectful ji is added]. Parents must have been thinking Oh boy, I should name this boy something. Why not just name the boy, just boy? That sounds so lazy.
<br>There are way better names than that.

What can we learn from the Mahabharata?
<html><body>
<br>This includes Krishna, Yudhisthira, Arjuna, Karna, Bhishma, Dronacharya, Abhimanyu, Duryodhaan, Ashwathamma, Jarasandha, Vidur, Shakuni, Vrushali, Draupadi, Shikhandini etc.
<br>Each major character has one epic flaw that put them through unspeakable misery.
<br>Edit:
<br>There are also some excellent characters like Yuyutsu, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, Vidura and Bhishma Pitamaha.
<br>Some commented that I have painted only the negative quality of these people. That is only because they have so many positives. Some positives.
<br>And, at last to please everyone let me add the Paramatma too.
<br>Krishna: Hack your way out of trouble. Victories don’t come merely by linear and simplistic thinking. Like a startup founder, Krishna worked around the rules. Let me give you an example.
<br>Duryodhana asked the counsel of Sahadeva to decide the day of sacrifice before the war. Deciding that day will provide a strategic advantage in the war. Sahadeva was so known for integrity and scholarship that even opposite side came to him for this critical advice. Krishan asked Sahadeva to either decline or provide wrong advice, but Sahadeva decline to mess with his professional integrity and chose the day of new moon [Amavasya].
<br>As a hacker, Krishna simply worked around this. He went to the nearby river the day before new moon and started doing the tharpanam [sacrifice]. Seeing Krishna Himself do this activity normally done on the newmoon day, everyone else assumed that they wrongly calculated that date and everyone [including Duryodhana] preponed their newmoon date by 1 day. Making Duryodhana do the sacrifice on the wrong day provided a key strategic advantage to Krishna.

What should 29 year-olds know and do before turning 30?
<html><body>
<br>That life doesn't end at 30.
<br>In 20s, we tend to have the notion that we are going to fall through a cliff that comes after 29. It is staring into the abyss. In pop culture this props through scenes like this.
<br>A popular scene from the Sitcom FRIENDS
<br>When I turned 29 I was so depressed. My wife made that birthday special by buying 29 different gifts that she gave throughout that day.
<br>Yesterday I turned 33 and I'm far more happier than I was 4 years ago. I have walked past the cliff and survived ;-) Now, I feel that I don't have just 2-3 years to make my life, but probably 60-70 years more to create something. That is so liberating and motivating.
<br>In some way, we play life like we play 20-20 cricket, when the game is actually a Test cricket. Like Yusuf Pathan we hurry our game & get out too early, wasting a large chunk of our time, when you should be playing like Rahul Dravid & win. It is a different game. Sure, past 30 you might not be able to run as NFL quarterback or play professional Soccer, but you can do so much useful things in your life.
<br>EDIT: Spoiler alert [if you have not already watched FRIENDS and still care about it, don’t read the next paragraph]
<br><spoiler>
<br>Coming back to FRIENDS, the lives of these 6 turned for the better after they turned 30. Monica & Chandler got babies & found their dream home, Joey was more stable in acting, Rachel found a great career & eventually hooked up with Ross and Phoebe was no longer that random & found the love of her life. In contrast, their 20s was much miserable, random and confusing.

What is your opinion on Manmohan Singh's tenure as the PM of India?
<html><body>
<br>In 2009, Manmohan Singh won a re-election after 5 years in office. Let me give you an indication of how unique that is. Before that, a Prime Minister won a re-election was in 1971, when Indira Gandhi trumped the capitalists. Even in the 1971 election, Indira didn't complete full 5 year term [she dissolved the Lok Sabha and brought the elections 1 year early to make use of favorable political climate] and we have to go to Pt. Nehru to be the only person before Manmohan Singh, who completed 5 years in office & then won the reelection convincingly.
<br>You cannot pull off that feat without doing a good job at office. Manmohan's first term was indeed quite good. I was living in DC when he first visited America [in 2005] and I remember seeing all the newspapers filled with this turbaned leader. Washington Post and other papers carried glowing reviews of Singh and India. He was well respected on his first tour and continued the good work of Vajpayee. Foreign policy was good and so was the economic policy.
<br>With the help of RBI's shrewd policies, he was able to steer India from the fallout of 2008 economic crisis [bringing the term of "decoupling"] and kept up the hope.
<br>However, like a Ferozshah Kotla pitch, things started spinning slowly. Cracks appeared and before anyone realized things were crazy & unplayable. While he started his second term with a lot of hope that would vanish quite quickly.
<br>Partly due to RTI and partly due to incompetence, the bureaucracy came to a standstill as officials became quite afraid to move files in the world they considered to be too transparent for normal business. Decision making came to a crawl and the Prime Minister was widely criticized. Sort of like how Raina and Ganguly played the bouncers during their torrid years, he was unable to break out of that criticism and kept falling ever since 2010. Corruption became the biggest talking point and scams came with eye-popping numbers that people could not even imagine.
<br>I will rate his first term as quite good, and the second term as awful [not coincidentally the same deterioration happened couple of years after Indira was re-elected in 1971 and Nehru in 1961]. Lack of competition makes the party leaders go complacent and start chasing their own trivial pursuits.
<br>As the Americans say, leaders are like underwear. They might be cosy and warm when fresh, but you never put them on for too long. Change them frequently.

What are some companies making tons of money but are unknown to most people?
<html><body>
<br>What are their business model and strategy like? Why are they still unknown despite being so rich? Deliberately?
<br>Ladies and gentlemen, let me present you Vitol. This is the most unusual of the world's largest companies. Although there are 8 companies in the world that are bigger than this [List of largest companies by revenue] those 8 are either well known companies or government organizations.
<br>Vitol is not a conglomerate. Unlike Aramco or Sinopoec this is not some government organization masquerading as a company. It is not a popular brand. It doesn't employ a lot of people [hardly 5000 employees]. It makes nearly as much as Samsung does from 2 dozen businesses while it employs 1/100 people of Samsung does. It is not traded in the stock markets. It is not a company that any consumer has heard of.
<br>But, this under the cover company makes more revenues than Apple, Toyota, Microsoft, JP Morgan and the brands you know. $270 billion dollars in annual revenues. . It is fairly secretive even though they are the largest independent energy trader in the world.
<br>They have over 17 million cubic meters of storage where they store fuels - coal, natural gas, oil etc and trade. Through this hoarding they control a lot of world market prices, besides enabling direct trading of many kinds. They even enable the ISIS to sell oil to the United States. How ISIS Oil Ended Up On US Streets - Companies like them enable despots and dictators to convert their resources to cash [Swiss firm Vitol pleads guilty in UN oil/food case]. In a way they are far more influential on geopolitics than Apple or Samsung.
<br>If you want to research on this secretive world, you need to enter Geneva where you can find Vitol's cousins - Trafigura, Gunvor, Glencore, Mercuria etc. I always imagine these folks be like this:

Why do the Andaman & Nicobar Islands belong to India?
<html><body>
<br>Geographically or using United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as rule of thumb, it could belong to Myanmar / Thailand / Malaysia / Indonesia.
<br>If historically based on colonization, it could belong to British.
<br>Andaman & Nicobar islands belong to India because the previous controllers of that land - UK - transferred the control to India. As simple as that.
<br>It was not that worthy to the UK and they also knew that India could take it by force if it wants to [INA got there, fairly easily]. And no other country disputed the transfer of control to India. Myanmar, Thailand and other countries all have agreed to Indian control over the islands. That should settle it. And neither Burmese nor Thai kingdoms had settled in the islands, thus no one has a legitimate right any more than India has.
<br>This is not any different from a person buying a house far from his home. You own that home because you bought the control from someone else or have been there for a very long time.
<br>UNCLOS is not relevant here because for 1) it is a manned island with an existing government and 2) the treaty came 3 decades after India controlled that island.

Narendra Modi: Why is Narendra Modi obsessed with taking selfies?
<html><body>
<br>Leaders are not robots. They deserve to have some fun for themselves. A number of leaders - including President Obama take selfies. As long as they are not spending 10 hours a day taking selfies it is good.
<br>Even more importantly, Modi tactically uses these selfies for promotion. A Prime Minister is also the nation's Chief Marketing Officer. He/she has to market things all day - they have market new bills with MPs, new treaties with foreign governments, new projects with people, improving execution of the bureaucrats.
<br>Each of these selfies help solve a problem even if it moves by only 0.0001%.
<br>Marketing to the NRIs and bringing them more closer to helping in India's solutions.
<br>Bringing UAE more closer to India than to Pakistan by doing promos in UAE newspapers.
<br>Bringing a more personable India to the Chinese.

Is the 5 year jail term for calling a North Eastern person in India a 'Chinki' justified?
<html><body>
<br>Calling a Northeasterner Chinki is not the same as calling a South Indian Madrasi. For one, Madrasi was an actual terminology as the Presidency of Madras covered a large portion of south India. It is outdated, but not really offensive. It is like calling a person from Haryana as a Punjabi. Not very offensive.
<br>On the other hand, there was no real territory called "chink" anywhere in India - not in the past nor present. In short, it is non-factual. And it is racial [as you are referring to someone by ethnicity]. And it is offensive [as you are calling them by a neighbor with whom India has fought a war].
<br>That said, 5 year jail term looks ridiculous. It looks more like a mockery, something that will never be implemented/implementable. If they can put the racists in jail even for 1 hour, it might solve a big chunk of the problem.

Does India really need bullet trains right now? I.e., instead of this we can invest to extend more railway lines in new areas.
<html><body>
<br>Still there is lot of areas in India need railway lines which really helps them.We are going to invest more than 1lakh crore in Bullet trains, instead of this we can use this money to develop more than 20,000 kilometers normal railway lines.
<br>The Indian government is not spending much money in the project. It is the Japanese government that is putting most of the investment. The Japanese are doing it because they want to prove their technology and get a foothold in the Indian market [preventing Chinese from doing the same].
<br>The government also has run feasibility studies and that show that the Japanese can get back the investment from the ticket sales. The case is the same as allowing a Japanese company called Suzuki to setup a car plant in Delhi 3 decades ago. The company was putting its money and made value for both themselves and to India [building Maruti and heralding the automobile revolution].
<br>If the Indian government were spending a lot of its own money on the Bullet train, then there would be a case for not going for this and instead spending on more needed projects. Given that someone else is spending the money, this point is moot.

Because of increasing pollution should Indian government make the import of Tesla car (or any other electric car) tax free? If no, then why?
<html><body>
<br>Tesla is "cleaner" only when it is powered by clean electricity [not fired by coal] and when compared with an Internal Combustion Engine. That is like judging a person good when compared with Adolf Hitler. While Tesla is a genius piece of technology, its carbon footprint is way higher than using public transportation or riding bicycles.
<br>As long as our grid is powered by coal/diesel and with such a massive transmission loss, it is pointless to even talk of electric cars [And our grid cannot withstand people drawing off such huge electricity]. Maybe in Germany or France they could start talking about [mostly use solar/nuclear]. And even then, it is not all good.
<br>Some mentioned that it will have no tailpipe emissions. Good. But, you know what? Most of the pollution in Indian cities come not from the tail pipes, but from when the car hits the edge of the road - throwing up dust [Why is air pollution worse in Delhi as compared to other mega-cities? (like Mumbai and Kolkata)] A Tesla Model 3 would bring up as much dust as any other car and it is that road dust that is the biggest health hazard now. Not to mention that the Model 3 like its dirtier cousins would occupy a large space in the Indian roads. Laying more roads is again dirty.
<br>For a gas guzzling nation like the United States, this is an improvement. For a train/cycle/moped reliant nation like India, it is a step backward. The worst part is people get to go off the guilt [a couple of my friends said, they are "cleaning" up the environment this way]. Is there a room in the world for 1.3 billion Indians buying their own 2000 pound vehicle of aluminum/steel?
<br>Sure, I have nothing against the Tesla and might even buy a Model 3 sometime after it hits the road. But, to think of a poor government subsidizing this is galling to me. Especially when the biggest health hazard for us now is the road dust and burning of biomass.
<br>As a country with 1.3 billion people and very limited resources, the government should use its scarce resources for transportation options with much lower carbon usage - trains, buses and bicycles.  That is where the tax subsidies should go to.

Lord Krishna stopped time to explain all 700 slokas of Bhagavad Gita. Did he really stop time? If yes, how? What is the real meaning of that?
<html><body>
<br>You can either take that literally or take it figuratively. While taking it literally looks fascinating, you can get the meaning by taking that figuratively.
<br>Imagine you are in the best concert of your life. You are getting a mindblowing [just figuratively] experience. You come out of the concert 2 hours later & believe you are in a different world altogether. However, for the friend outside who has come to pick you it is just any other 2 hours and nothing really changed in his life.
<br>In a sense, the time stopped - the 2 hours changed your life, while the same two hours did nothing to your friend. The way in which we perceive time depends on how engaging the circumstances are.
<br>[Edit: People keep asking me what others were doing. In English, people talk about 150-180 words per minute. Indians in native language likely talk slightly faster - say 200 words per minute. A shloka is about 10 words long and that means a native could speak 20 shlokas in a minute and the entire Gita in about 35 minutes.
<br>Before the battle, they had a few hours to plan & observe, while soldiers were arranged in formations. In those few hours, it is quite easy to fit 35 minutes of conversation. Also, there is no indication that it all happened at once. It could have happened over several days where they had side conversation. If you were fighting for 18 days - a lot of times not even involving you, imagine how many hours you would have to talk with your driver]

Why did Roman Saini resign from IAS?
<html><body>
<br>Roman has already written an answer. I'm shocked that he needs to defend himself as though he murdered someone. Since when is teaching India become a waste of public money?
<br>While in India, we think as though people are built for one kind of career for life, in more successful parts of the world a lot of people successfuly connect multiple disciplines by switching between them.
<br>I used to sit next to a guy who had a Phd in Neuroscience and then a MBA and then a work experience as CTO in a tech company. One might wonder what do these three unconnected fields have in common. If it were an Indian uncle/aunty sitting next to him, she might have said: "Beta, you are wasting your life".  He didn't waste his life. Rather, he invented a pocket sized ECG device [InvisionHeart] that is making heart treatment affordable and easy. He combined his knowledge of medicine, business and technology to pull this through.
<br>That is what many smart people do. Like how Sir Isaac Newton combined his strength in Mathematics & observations of nature to lay the foundations of modern Physics, they combine the best of different fields to produce amazing connections.
<br>It is human to feel jealous. It is even human to be curious about the lives of other people. However, it is true assholery to abuse & troll others for their career choices.

Which country is the most difficult to invade?
<html><body>
<br>Japan. There has never been a foreign born person ruling the country in its history. Only the most powerful weapon ever - Atomic bomb - could make them surrender and even that was not enough for a full transfer of control. Even the Mongols failed there twice. Every other civilization has been invaded in the past. History of Japan
<br>Russia has been invaded [by Mongols and the Scandinavian before them]; Afghanistan has been invaded many times by Indian empires; China has been invaded [by Mongols, Manchus and Japan]; Switzerland has been invaded many times - people forget that its independence is relatively recent and as recently as in the 19th century they have been invaded by France [Helvetic Republic]; Britain had been invaded by the Romans, Angles, Saxons, Vikings, Normans...
<br>Why is Japan so hard to conquer?
<br>Islands are always hard to conquer and Japan's islands especially Honshu is among the largest island by population. It is not easy to conquer a population that has high emphasis on sustaining itself. New Zealand is an island too, but Japan has more than 25 times its population. It is  easier to overpower the 4.4 million Kiwis than to do the same to 127 million Japanese.
<br>Britain is an island too and has some of the advantages, but besides being a little smaller, it is far more closer to the mainland. Crossing the East China sea between Japan & China is far more harder than crossing the north sea or the English channel. Britain also has a number of powers surrounding it. In case of Japan, there is the frozen Siberia, the Korean peninsula and China being the only challenges. Korea is smaller, Russia cannot easily supply to Siberia and that leaves China as the only real threat - and they are a few hundred miles off the ocean.
<br>In short, Japan is not just a massively populated island, but quite remote too.
<br>Compare that with Canada, whose population all live close to the US border and the US could just take over all the border cities with a lot less pain than taking over Japan. It also much smaller population [1/4 of Japan].
<br>Britain also has historical fault lines between English & Scots - an alliance that could break apart [with a future referendum] and having two powers in the island can make things easier for an outside power. Japan is far more secure in that point - there are no major fault lines between its major islands.
<br>Island + large population + remote location + history of non-submission  = practically impossible to invade.
