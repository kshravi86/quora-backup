Why do we use AC supply in our homes?
<html><body>
<br>Thomas Edison thought we should use DC. Nikola Tesla thought we should use AC. There was a great competition between the two, and Tesla won.
<br>The value of AC is that the voltage can be changed easily with a transformer. High voltage suffers much less loss in long transmission lines, and then the voltage can be reduced for safe introduction into the home. Ridiculous reason, thought Edison; we don’t need long transmission lines, he argued—just place a coal burning generator every few blocks in the city.
<br>Thanks to Tesla, most of our power generation is done at distant places, and I am thankful for that! The right reason won.
<br>Here’s the math: the power lost in a wire is given by L = (I^2)R, where L is the power lost to heat, I is the current and R is the resistance. The power transmitted is given by P = VI, where P is the power delivered to the customer, V is the voltage. So if you make V big and I small, you can transmit the same power but reduce the power lost to heat. So high voltage gives the best performance.
<br>Of course, high voltage could be delivered by DC also, but at the time there was no convenient way to reduce the voltage for use in the home. These days, with advanced DC converters, the DC voltage can be reduced, so many long-distance transmission lines are now DC. They have several advantages, including the fact that they use a lower peak voltage (since the signal doesn’t oscillate) and they do not induce eddy-current loses in the ground from their fluctuating magnetic fields.
<br>(Note to experts: in my equation I neglected the voltage drop in the transmission line in order to keep the math simple. At low current that is small.)

What is the best way to reduce belly fat and overall weight?
<html><body>
<br>Eat less. There’s no real alternative.
<br>Most dieters are so concerned about second-order effects, such as daily fluctuations in weight and changes in metabolism, that they lose track of the first law of thermodynamics: conservation of energy.
<br>Want to lose a pound of fat? You can work it off by hiking to the top of a 2,500-story building. Or by running 60 miles. Or by spending 7 hours cleaning animal stalls. (It is amazing what scientists have actually measured. This last example is tabulated in the book Exercise Physiology by G. Brooks and T. Fahey.)
<br>Exercise is a very difficult way to lose weight. Here's a rule of thumb: exercise very hard for one hour (swimming, running, or racquetball)– and you'll lose about one ounce of fat. Light exercise for an hour (gardening, baseball, or golf) will lose you a third of an ounce. That number is small because fat is a very energy-dense substance: it packs about 4,000 food calories per pound, the same as gasoline, and 15 times as much as in TNT.
<br>If you run for an hour, you'll lose that ounce of fat and also a pound or two of water. By the next day, when you've replenished the water, you might think, 'the weight came right back!' But you'd be wrong -- you really did lose an ounce. It is hard to notice, unless you keep running every day for a month or more, and don't reward yourself after each run with a cookie.
<br>There is a much easier way to lose weight, as we can learn from the first law of thermodynamics. Eat less.
<br>A reasonable daily diet for an adult is 2,000 food calories. That's 8.36 megajoules per day, or about 100 joules per second -- in other words, 100 watts. Most of that ends up as heat, so you warm a room as much as a bright light bulb. Cut your consumption by 600 calories per day and you'll lose a pound of fat every week. Most diet experts consider that a reasonable goal. Don't drop below 1,000 calories per day, or you might get lethargic. But at 1,400 calories per day, you can easily maintain an active life.
<br>Of course, there is a catch. You'll be hungry.
<br>It's not real hunger–not like the painful hunger of starving people in impoverished countries. It's more of a mild ache, or an itch that you mustn't scratch. To be popular, a diet must somehow cope with this hunger. Weight Watchers does it with peer support. The food pyramid does it by encouraging you to eat unlimited celery. Some high-fat diets satisfy all your old cravings -- and figure you'll eventually cut back the butter you put on your bacon.
<br>I put theory into practice. In 2003, I had once again grown out of my belt. I wasn't grossly overweight: 205 pounds in a six-foot, one-inch body. That wouldn't be bad for a football player, but I'm 59 years old, and the excess pounds weren't in muscle. I had gained a pound a year for several decades. I felt heavy and old. I decided to try conservation of energy. I gave up lunch and snacks.
<br>How to cope with the hunger? I attempted to enjoy it. I thought of the movie Lawrence of Arabia, in which T.E. Lawrence says, 'The trick is not minding that it hurts.' I told myself that the mild ache was only the sensation of evaporating fat. That interpretation has some basis in physics. When you lose weight, most of your fat is converted to the gases carbon dioxide and water vapor, and so you get rid of fat by breathing it out of your body.
<br>Physics works, and I lost weight. By August, I was down to 175 pounds, a 30-pound drop. My belt went from 42 inches to 36 inches. My Zen-like approach to hunger also worked; I found myself declining offers of chocolate cake because I didn't want to lose the sensation of evaporation. I didn't change my level of activity, and managed to maintain my diet while taking trips to Cuba and Alaska -- and during a week-long backpacking excursion in the Sierra Nevada. A key innovation: I kept up the social aspects of lunch, without eating. I watched others gobbling cheeseburgers, while I sipped diet cola. It really wasn't that hard to do. And the mild afternoon discomfort was compensated by several positive developments. Dinner became truly wonderful. I hadn't had pre-dinner hunger for decades. A sharp appetite turns a meal into a feast. No more cheese 'appetizers' for me.
<br>Moreover -- and this may sound silly coming from a physicist -- I was surprised that I began to feel lighter. I no longer walk down streets -- I float. Distant stores seem closer. And my knees have responded to the lighter load. Their aching, which I had mistakenly attributed to aging, went away.
<br>Food is instant gratification. And fast-food chains and gourmet restaurants serve tasty food at remarkably low cost. It is a situation unprecedented in history and unanticipated by our genes. No wonder we are overweight.
<br>Anybody can lose weight. Energy is conserved. Just stop scratching that itch. Of course, you'll have to sacrifice instant gratification. Is it worth it? You decide. Food is delicious and cheap. You might reasonably choose to take advantage of this unique historical circumstance, and decide to be fat.
<br>It's been seven months since I started my diet, and two months since I left it. I've begun eating a light lunch, and having an occasional small snack. I'm still at 175. But I never want to lose the delicious edge of hunger before dinner, or the floating sensation when I walk. Moving takes less energy now, so I have more energy. I no longer feel like a spherical physicist. And for losing weight, dieting sure beats cleaning animal stalls.
<br>—Note: this answer is based on an essay I wrote in 2003 for MIT’s “Technology Review.” I have gained back a bit of weight since then, mostly because I now eat lunch about half the time. I currently weigh 185 lb. That’s still 20 lb. lighter than when I started the physics diet, and pretty good for 14 years later.

Is it true that there is a professor at UC Berkeley who receives a standing ovation at the end of every lecture? If so, what is his/her name and why?
<html><body>
<br>Ken Jowitt.
<br>I had heard the story about his standing ovations, and so I decided to see for myself. Yes, indeed, he got one at the end of every lecture, but what I discovered was that it was not done for tradition; Jowitt earned it for each lecture. I was astonished. His lectures were composed like a great symphony. There were motifs, themes, fugues, movements; Jowitt used words in a way that reminded me of the way I use (in physics) equations. His lectures were never meant to entertain; they were meant to inspire and educate. They covered enormous amounts of challenging material, but made it make sense. He used language in a way that I can only compare to Shakespeare, with alliteration and metaphor and other figures of speech to make his concepts more vivid and more memorable.
<br>I wound up attending every lecture for a semester. Jowitt later told me that my presence made him nervous; he is a great admirer of physics, and was a little uncomfortable having a physics professor in the room. I learned that he spent enormous effort in composing his lectures, and at the end of each, he was exhausted.
<br>To be more precise, Jowitt never lectured; he taught. I’ll give an example. He would begin a subject, for example, his theory of the modern city as a castle. He began by telling the class to set aside their pens and computers, and to just listen; no note taking allowed. He told them he would finish after 10 minutes, and then he would repeat everything; the second time through note taking was allowed and encouraged.
<br>As I said, this is not lecturing but teaching. By the second time though, the students knew what was important and what was not, and they were able to take far better notes.
<br>His lecture was nominally 80 minutes, but after 50 minutes he invited everyone to leave. He said he would continue, but with no required material. About ⅔ left. Then he moved into extended discussion of the material, and got lots of questions from the remaining students, each one answered with care and clarity. I could not understand why so many students left.
<br>A decade later I was given the “Distinguished Teaching” award at UC Berkeley. In my short acceptance speech, I said that I had learned more about teaching from that semester listening to Ken Jowitt than I had from any other experience in my life. I’m sure there are many others who could make similar statements. What this means is that the greatness of Jowitt’s teachings will live on far beyond Jowitt himself; indeed and alas, Jowitt is now retired from teaching.

How will the anti-Trump liberals react, if President Trump turns the nation around for the better, and they can't say, "I told you so"?
<html><body>
<br>I read Anti-Trumpers constantly forecasting, “I told you so” because Trump will fail. Then they say, “but I hope he doesn't.” How will they possibly rationalize great success by Trump? They were sure he'd lose and they were wrong. Our politicians failed, now our captains of industry will save us.
<br>There is a precedent for the present President: Ronald Reagan. When he ran for office, liberals considered him to be ignorant, stupid, and a fool. They continued to mock him after he was elected. But they also feared that he would get us into war. His name for the Soviet Union, “The Evil Empire”, was only one indication that the Doomsday Clock was getting extremely close to midnight.
<br>I remember all this clearly, because I participated. Virtually all of my friends and colleagues at Berkeley felt the same way. We considered the few Republicans on campus to be peculiar people who must have been brought up in very wealthy families and who were inherently selfish.
<br>I’m a bit embarrassed to remember how naïve I was back then. That was a very long time ago. Today I don’t consider myself to be a liberal or a conservative. The world is too complicated for a simple slate of answers to subtle questions. But I do remember how clearly I thought I saw the world back then.
<br>Today I consider it remarkable that many Democrats think of President Reagan in a positive way. True, many liberals don’t extoll him, but they also don’t mock him. And similarly, many Republicans look back on President Clinton with an enhanced degree of respect.
<br>In the end we judge Presidents, not on what they said or what they proposed, but on what they accomplish. It will take some time before we know how history (and how you and I) will ultimately judge the present President.

What is your opinion on the UC Berkeley protest against Milo Yiannopoulos (Feb 2017)?
<html><body>
<br>When I first arrived on the Berkeley Campus, I went to a talk by a neo-Nazi. It was 1964, three months before the “Free Speech Movement”. I saw the announcement of the upcoming presentation, and I was curious—so I attended. About 250 students showed up. The speaker was introduced (in very neutral terms) and he spoke for about 45 minutes. The audience listened politely.
<br>When he finished, questions were solicited. I noticed a pattern: the students were asking pointed questions, often involving logic or history, and they seemed to confound the speaker. It was almost a student competition: who could ask the most devastating question! The speaker was confused; he almost seemed to stutter; he was embarrassed. He had no good answers. Each succeeding student seemed to be able to ask even better questions that left the neo-Nazi helpless. He came across as an ignorant and utter fool.
<br>I walked out absolutely delighted. I had seen free speech in action! It worked. Possibly everyone in the audience came away feeling as I did. Even supporters of the neo-Nazi must have been appalled at his ineptitude.
<br>A few weeks later, a student was arrested and expelled for engaging in a political presentation at the corner of Bancroft and Telegraph, right at the edge of campus. I and a large number of students felt that the administration was undermining the free speech that we so much appreciated, and that I had seen so beautifully demonstrated at the neo-Nazi talk. Soon afterwards there was a peaceful sit-in at Sproul Hall. I was arrested; I spent the night in the Oakland jail (much more interesting than the Santa Rita camp where most arrestees went). Soon after that I described my experiences to a wonderful student I had just met, and we’ve now been happily married for over 50 years.
<br>What happened in Berkeley last night? There was a speech scheduled by a controversial person (some might classify him as a neo-Nazi, but he was nothing compared to the actual neo-Nazi of 1964). Some students had organized a peaceful protest. Too bad; it would have been much better and more effective to attend his speech and hit him with embarrassing questions. A group of about 150 anarchists soon arrived, and, covered with black masks to hide their identities, and using the peaceful protesters as cover, began to attack the building violently. From my home a mile away I could hear much of it. I watched the terrible events on local news and video tweets.
<br>I visited the area this morning. Somehow the image on TV had given an exaggerated image of what happened. Damage to property was minimal, with most having happened on one corner of the Student Union building.
<br>Had the protesters used the 1964 tradition, attend-listen-embarrass, this could not have happened. It was the presence of thousands of innocent students that allowed the anarchists to denigrate free speech and leave the police virtually helpless to stop the violence.
<br>I strongly urge the campus to revert to the old form of free speech, the kind I saw and loved in 1964, attend-listen-embarrass. It is effective and avoids the danger of a small group of extremists leveraging your disagreement with the speaker for their own violent ends.
<br>Of course, the attend-listen-embarrass approach does have a downside too. If you listen to the speaker, he might actually influence the way you think about things. Personally, I love that aspect. Sometimes what I know about a speaker turns out to be wrong or exaggerated, and polite listening actually affects the way I think about the world. I’m never afraid to listen.

Have you ever scammed a scammer?
<html><body>
<br>I got a phone call from a person claiming to represent the US Government. He wanted to speak to my (adult) daughter, but I was suspicious, and asked him for details. He said that she had missed jury duty, and was about to be arrested, but if we acted quickly, we could avert the damage.
<br>I told him that I wanted to protect her, and that, if possible, it would be best if she never even learned about the problem. What could I do? He said that for a $500 fee, they could expedite a document that would avoid all prosecution. I said I would do that; how do we proceed? He said we could meet at a local CVS Pharmacy; he would bring the forms, I could sign them, and he would file them. But he had to get the funds in cash, not check or credit card.
<br>I agreed to do this, but (I said) I needed to have his cell phone number so I could find him. He was reluctant, but I insisted. He handed his phone over to his boss. I was so sincere, and so compliant, that he met my request, and gave me the cell phone number.
<br>I then told the man that I was reporting the scam, and that his cell phone number would soon be inoperative. If it is possible for them to trace who had bought it, then he would be in even deeper trouble.
<br>He got very upset with me. He asked me if I was a psychologist. (That’s because my counter-scam had seemed professional to him.) We chatted for about ten minutes. I told him that his scam was unfair and harmful. He responded by saying that he only took money from people who had cheated the government. I suggested that he get a better job. He said he had tried, but six months ago he had been released from prison, and all prospective employers had turned him down.
<br>He finished with some chilling words: “You realize, of course, that I know where you live.”

Are there any scientists out there on Quora who do not believe in climate change?
<html><body>
<br>I don’t believe in most of what appears in the newspapers called “climate change”. In my studies, I’ve found that variability in temperature is not increasing. Nor are storms; the number of hurricanes and tornadoes, including the more violent ones, are steady and possibly decreasing. There is not an increase in drought or flooding.
<br>But temperature is rising, and that is due to human emissions of greenhouse gases. We show this independent of the IPCC work, in our published papers. See BerkeleyEarth.org.
<br>I summarize my perspective by saying that global warming is real and human caused, however “climate change” —other than the warming—is mostly hyperbole. That is not to say that big changes will not occur in the future; I think those are likely, and that’s why I am spending most of my time working to slow and stop global warming. But exaggerating the changes happening today simply creates public distrust of science.
<br>I also have concluded that the programs being proposed by politicians and diplomats on all sides will not help because they do not address the (unfortunate) fact that most of the emissions of the future are expected to come from China and the developing world. Electric cars will not help, since in China they would create more CO2 than would gasoline. (Chinese electricity comes predominantly from coal.) Treaties that focus on reductions in the developed world are ineffective if they don’t set examples that the developing world can afford to follow. I am not concerned about us withdrawing from the Paris accord because I thought it was a step in the wrong direction. If it is not profitable, it is not sustainable. Solar is far too variable to be more than 10% of the mix; what would India do during the Monsoon? Add in energy storage and the expense goes way up. What we need is to help the developing world (including China) develop and build nuclear plants, develop their natural gas capability (½ to ⅓ the greenhouse emissions of coal), and to improve their energy conservation.

Is it possible to create time?
<html><body>
<br>Yes, if my new theory of the flow of time is correct. In that theory, time is generated whenever new space is created. We can “create” new space by concentrating mass. The most important creation of new space that we observe is the continuing expansion of the universe, and in the theory, that’s why we keep having new seconds available. The most dramatic creation of new local space was in the LIGO gravitational wave observation in which two large black holes combined, creating in that process millions of new cubic kilometers, and about 1 millisecond of new time; see my eNow—The Physics of Time and our paper Now, and the Flow of Time. If the theory is correct, then amounts of time can be created locally just by moving masses around. We hope to be able to test this in the laboratory in the next year or two.

What's the most disturbing truth about marriage?
<html><body>
<br>The average duration of a marriage in colonial America was less than 12 years. (Reference: The Way We Never Were by Stephanie Coontz of The Evergreen State College, page 10.) Those marriages didn’t end in divorce, but typically in death: accident, child-birth, war, and manslaughter. Numbers were probably similar in Europe, since the causes of short marriages were universal.
<br>The conceptual consequence is that marriage has not, traditionally, been a relationship for long duration. Since I have been married for over 50 years (to the same person!), friends of mine are typically embarrassed when they tell me their marriage is breaking up. I console them with the thought that long-term marriages are not something that the institution was designed for, so they shouldn’t feel as if they “failed”. Having a long marriage, in my mind, is like winning a Nobel Prize; it is not something to expect, but something worth working towards, and something to be grateful for if it happens.

I just did horribly on a test. Is it in poor taste to send the professor an email apologizing and explaining that I've been having personal issues?
<html><body>
<br>The professor knows me better than most and I am typically a high performer. I don’t want to seem like a kiss ass or like I’m making excuses, but I also don’t want it to look like I don’t care.
<br>Yes , send the letter. Your attitude is remarkable and refreshing; I like that fact that you are apologizing to the professor. You feel that you’ve let the professor down; you haven’t mastered what the professor was teaching, and it’s not the professor’s fault.
<br>When I assign final grades, I often look for things that don’t fit in. If a student has consistently done well but messed up on one exam, I will not just average it in, but will tend to discount it. I am not trying to be “fair”—I am trying to be accurate. A letter such as yours would also factor in and support my deduction that the one grade is discordant.
<br>However—do you plan to do better on the next exam? Do your personal problems persist? My recommendation to you is that you do well on that next exam even if your personal problems continue. Think of the athlete who has to perform even though he aches. Most professionals must perform even when their lives have problems. Take this as an opportunity to do well, despite your personal problems. It is a skill that is worth learning, and it can be done.

If a situation like in the movie "Martian" arises, would NASA (or some other space agency) spend few billions to save that one person?
<html><body>
<br>The government is completely inconsistent when they consider the monetary value of a human life. For nuclear power, when it evaluates the monetary cost of an accident, it uses the figure of $3 million per life. Thus, if a safety system costs $2 million, and is likely over its lifetime to save 1 life, then it is required (since it costs less than the life saved).
<br>Yet we could spend $10,000 in ambulance service, and save one life. The fact that many regions don’t have better ambulance service can be interpreted as society’s unwillingness to spend $10,000 for a life.
<br>If the money is spent in the developing world, then it gets more out of balance. By paying for nurses to vaccinate, we could probably save lives for under $10 per life. (If someone has a better number published somewhere, I’d be interested in knowing the reference.)
<br>So, although people will say that the purpose of the money is to “save a life”, that reason is not consistent with the way we do it. We let people die when only a few dollars could save them.
<br>Yet I suspect the movie “The Martian” correctly depicts the way the government would act. A public life is valued at a much higher level than a random and anonymous life.

Is it possible to solve every differential equation in this world?
<html><body>
<br>I was sitting in on a lecture on controlled nuclear fusion. It was very mathematical and I could barely follow the lecturer. Then he got to one point in which the equation seemed to have six terms, and he said, “So you see, we have reduced it to the Liputitian form, and thus it is solved!” I had no idea what he meant, but as I looked around the room, I saw several people nodding; some smiles as if he had just done something brilliant. He continued in writing the general form of the solution (in terms of functions I had never heard of), and eventually I gave up and left.
<br>Later that afternoon, I asked Rip Perkins, one of the physicists who had been in the room—and who had nodded—about the Liputitian form. I told him I had never heard of it. His response, as best I can remember it, was this: “Of course you’ve never heard of it. You’re not an applied mathematician. There are only a few differential equations that we mathematicians and physicists can solve, so it is a really big deal when a new one is solved. The Liputitian equation was solved last year, and it was big news in our community. You can see how it helps already. But I wouldn’t expect that anyone, not even you, who doesn’t spend full time in differential equations would know about it.”
<br>Unfortunately, I actually have forgotten the name of the equation that was solved, so I made up a name: Liputitian. You won’t find any such differential equation listed on Wikipedia. But this incident took place around 30 years ago, and maybe some applied mathematician will be able to tell me what Rip was referring to.
<br>NOTE ADDED: Commenter Preyas Shah suggested that I may be remembering developments in the Lyapunov form that took place in 1977. I did indeed attend meetings with Rip Perkins over several decades, including the years right after 1977, so that might be right! So Liputitian was my misremembered Lyapunov! Unfortunately, Rip passed away a few years ago so I can’t ask him. Thanks Preyas!

What is the difference between meters per second and meters per second²?
<html><body>
<br>When I first heard of square seconds, my mind boggled and my learning almost came to an end. It took a while, but I finally figured it out. Now I teach about them.
<br>It’s easier to understand if, instead of meters per second, you talk in terms of miles per hour. You start at rest. After one second, you are going 1 mph. A second later you are going 2 mph. A second after that, 3 mph. You are gaining one mph every second. That’s pretty straightforward, and it's the way we describe acceleration.
<br>An acceleration of 1 mph every second could be written as 1 mph/s.
<br>Now instead of mph, think of meters/sec. I’ll write these as m/s. You start at rest, and after 1 second you are going 1 m/s. After 2 seconds your velocity is 2 m/s. After 3 seconds you have a velocity of 3 m/s. You are gaining a meter-per-second every second.
<br>Now suppose you want to confuse a student. Instead of saying you are gaining a meter-per-second every second, you say you are gaining 1 m/s every second. Then to make it one step more abstract, you say your acceleration is 1 m/s/s. (Symbols for 1 meter-per-second per second.)
<br>Now to leave half the class behind, instead of explaining any of that, you simply write 1 m/s/s as 1 m/(s s) = 1m/s². You’ve introduced square seconds!
<br>Square seconds are simply seconds multiplied by seconds.
<br>In summary, 1 m/s is a velocity, and 1m/s² is a rate of change of velocity, an acceleration, a measure of how rapidly your velocity is changing.
<br>Once you have mastered square seconds, you are on your way to making people think that by having studied and understood physics, you are very smart.

What is the most clever life hack you've learned?
<html><body>
<br>The human appendage signal.
<br>I’m in tight traffic, and nobody will let me in to change lanes. They ignore my blinking turn signal. So I open the window and stick out my arm. Invariably, the car in the next lane slows and makes a spot for me to move into.
<br>I think the human appendage signal turns car into a person. It is no longer a blinking car that wants to change lanes, but a human. That triggers empathy and politeness.
<br>This hack can be used elsewhere. The gay liberation movement made its greatest strides when gays came out of the closet, and people realized that they knew such people. They were no longer abstractions, but people, friends, and it created a phase transition.
<br>Make sure others always see you as a person, not as a symbol or as a professional or as a thing.

Did your child ever hear you say a word that they now repeat?
<html><body>
<br>My mother told our babysitter not to say the word “no” to my sisters and me, as she did not want us to be the children parroting it back to her and my father for any reason. She was permitted to use any other phrase or action to stop our behavior. As a result, we rarely said it once we learned it.
<br>My daughter was playing by herself, and suddenly she said “fuck”. My wife asked her what that meant. She said, “It means the sink is broken.”
<br>I never use that word, and neither does my wife, so I assume she heard it at school or at a neighbors house …
<br>I told this story once to Art Linkletter, author of the best selling “Kids Say the Darndest Things”, and he began including it in his repertoire for personal appearances. I was in his audience once when he didn’t know I was there, and I heard him use it. But he substituted the weaker word “shit” for the actual 4-letter word my daughter had used.
<br>I haven’t heard her use it again.
<br>For my children, we also frequently say “oops” when they drop or spill something. It quickly becomes part of their vocabulary. My grandson would hold his spoon, say “oops”, and then throw it on the floor.
<br>I’ve also been on the other side of this phenomenon:
<br>Some years ago, before my mom died, we were talking about foreign language use at home. She spoke in her parents’ tongue, Slovak, whenever she wanted to communicate with her sister and have us not understand.
<br>I said to her that the only words that I remembered her saying was something that sounded like “Yezus moy, marry mackabosa.” She was abashed and embarrassed. She said those words meant “My Jesus, Mary mother of God”, and were used as swear words. (I guess I knew they were always used in anger or frustration, but I had never known their meaning.) She seemed horrified that she had used those words so often that even though I didn’t know what they meant, I remembered them.

What do you tell a police officer when he asks you to recite the alphabet backwards?
<html><body>
<br>I would do it, quickly, and enjoy his surprise.
<br>Then I would ask him if I did it correctly, and enjoy his confusion and doubt. And I would try to guess if he considered me to be a genius or a freak.
<br>I am neither. When I was a teenager, somebody was asked to recite the alphabet backwards and had a hard time. I recall thinking, someday someone will ask me … I’ll be prepared! And I proceeded to memorize it backwards. It’s very easy to do; after all, 2-year-olds can often recite it forward.
<br>Alas, many decades have passed, and I have never been asked to do it. I just tried it to see if I still have it; I do. I can say it as fast backward as forward.
<br>I did find this skill useful when in college I discovered I could get into a concert for free by volunteering to be an usher. Leading people to their seats was much easier when I could count the rows backwards; the entry was in the rear, with the rows at the back at the end of the alphabet.
<br>If you ever meet someone who purports to be me, ask that person to say the alphabet backwards. That’s a good way to check to see if you have the right guy.

Simple question: What are some really small things a relationship can't do without?
<html><body>
<br>Pins.
<br>Let me explain. Years ago there was a wonderful TV series called “The Adams Chronicles”. It told the story of John Adams, second President of the US, and his wife Abigail.
<br>There was a scene in which John was in Philadelphia for an extended time, much to Abigail’s discomfort and distress. He was involved in some very big issues; I don’t quite remember what they were, but something like writing the Constitution. He knew it was a moment in history in which major decisions would determine the future of the republic, and he was working very hard at it. But then he told his colleagues, all famous founders of the US, that he had to leave the meeting to go to a store to buy some pins. They didn’t understand. He couldn’t leave this Earth-changing moment to buy pins, they said! But he insisted. He said that if he returned to Massachusetts without pins, he would have hell to pay.
<br>When he finally travelled home, Abigail was distraught, seemingly on the brink of a nervous breakdown. She knew that what John was doing in Philadelphia was important and historic, but her life had been miserable. It was almost impossible to run the farm without him, and the distractions of her young children made it even worse. It really seemed that their relationship, formerly a wondrous one, was on the brink of collapse. So then she said to John, “I bet you forgot the pins”.
<br>“No, I have them right here.”
<br>She broke out in tears, ran to John and hugged him.
<br>The symbolism of that, to me, was that no matter what you are doing, don’t forget your spouse. Those pins were a symbol to Abigail that John had not forgotten her, that he still cared even when away, even when involved in monumental time consuming and world-changing tasks.
<br>Just a few weeks ago, my wife had to leave early for a trip and didn’t want me to have to get up early; so she let me sleep in. When I did get up I discovered that she had made fresh coffee for me. I could tell that she didn’t drink any herself; the coffee was for me. I was sure that she was rushing to get to the airport, maybe not as rushed as John Adams was in Philadelphia, but rushed. But she had found the time to make me coffee. She had remembered the pins.

How can you be sure the person you’re going to marry is the one?
<html><body>
<br>I recommend the backpack test. Both of my children agreed to this, and it appears (so far) to have worked successfully for them.
<br>The basic idea is this: for a marriage to last, the partners need to recognize that there will be periods of intense stress, non-romantic moments (often lasting days or longer) when life gets tough. It could be illness, or lack of money, or just something serious going wrong. Maybe a flat tire. Maybe you arrive at midnight at the cabin you rented and you discover the key doesn’t work. How will you and your partner-to-be handle it? Will you work well together? Will your love continue despite the stress?
<br>Take a week-long backpack trip together. Or do something equivalent. I like backpacking because doing it, particularly in Yosemite or anywhere in the Sierras, is a wonderful exhilarating spiritual experience. But—and this is the key—it always has moments of stress. It may suddenly rain, and you get unexpectedly wet. Maybe it will be cold in the morning, and you (or your partner) will not want to get up to fetch and heat water. One time it snowed suddenly, and we couldn’t find a sheltered place to camp. Maybe one of you will develop a blister. Maybe one of you will feel that you would like to transfer some weight to the partner. Maybe you will get lost. Maybe a bear will steal your food. Maybe one or both of you will get very tired, and grumpy.
<br>Before you get married, you want to experience stress together, ideally over an extended time. A few days is minimal; a week is better; a two week trip is probably more than enough. I recall taking such a trip with my wife-to-be, and a good friend and his wife. I was appalled at the way he treated her. When her pack was uncomfortable, he told her to endure it until they got to a good rest spot. (My wife and I insisted we stop until her pack was comfortable!) He didn’t help her in the cooking. He just didn’t seem to care. After that trip, I could never again think of him as a good friend. And indeed, a few years later, he and his wife were divorced.
<br>Don’t go backpacking with casual friends you want to keep. You may grow to dislike them when you see them under stress, and then you will not even want to be casual friends with them. That was my experience in the trip I just described.
<br>It doesn’t count to go on a romantic vacation, staying at hotels that take care of all your needs. A day trip isn’t good enough. You’ve got to experience extended stress; even better if the stress is unexpected. My bride to be and I went on several backpack trips before and during marriage. Perhaps the most dramatic one was a two-week trip that had rain, snow, terrible blisters, discomfort, bears, and all sorts of stress. We came back from that trip loving each other much more than we had imagined possible.

What are the most mind-blowing tricks used during any war?
<html><body>
<br>In the first year of World War II , the British had achieved an unbelievable technological breakthrough: they had developed magnetrons, devices that could produce such intense microwaves that they made radar possible. For many months the Germans were unaware of this. Had they invaded the UK, they very likely would have succeeded, but because of successful British deception, they greatly overestimated the number of British fighter aeroplanes. The reason was that every time the Germans sent a squadron over the channel, they were met by British fighters. They thought that the British had thousands of planes deployed all along the coast. In fact, the number was quite small, but the Brits could see the Germans coming, so they could always meet them. Some people say that radar was the invention that saved Britain.
<br>Even more remarkable was the cover story that the British spread to hide the radar technology. There was a known medical connection between an illness called “night blindness” and a deficiency of vitamin A. So the British spread the story that they were able to counter the Germans by feeding their pilots lots of carrots, which have abundance of vitamin A. This story did indeed leak and the Germans believed it and they started feeding their pilots carrots too. In fact, carrots do not improve your eyesight; they just cure a rare vitamin deficiency disease.
<br>The amusing part of this is that the British families also heard that carrots improve eyesight, and told their children to finish their carrots for stronger eyes. The mistaken information spread rapidly around the world. When I was a child, that is what my mom told me! Many people today still believe that false story that eating carrots is good for your eyes.
<br>I had heard this story from Luis Alvarez, who had been in Britain helping fighter pilots with the “Ground-Controlled Approach” that he had developed (and which had saved hundreds of lives of the pilots). Many years later, I had the honor to meet R.V. Jones, the man in Britain who was in charge of deception. He wrote a book about British use of deception in WWII called Most Secret War and I talked to him about his experiences. He verified to me that he had been the person responsible for the carrot deception.

You're flying a small plane when the Earth stops spinning for 10 seconds, then starts spinning again. What do you do?
<html><body>
<br>Prepare for death. If you are flying at 10,000 ft, you have less than 2 seconds to live.
<br>The sudden stopping of the Earth will generate an extremely intense shock wave in the air. It will move up from the surface at a velocity somewhat greater than the speed of sound. If the ground is 10,000 ft below, then the shock wave will hit you in under 2 seconds. When it does, your plane will undergo an intense jerk and you will be smashed against the walls of the plane.
<br>If you assume that the air stops too, then you will be moving at about 1000 mph through the air, well above Mach 1, and your airplane will be smooshed immediately.

What are your daily rituals?
<html><body>
<br>I get up by 7:15 each morning, put on coffee, and prepare hot chocolate for my father-in-law (age 95). I bring it up to him and ask him if he would like some hot chocolate; he answers, “I would love some hot chocolate.” We chat for a few minutes, and I go downstairs to have breakfast with my wife. My grandchildren usually stop by on the way out. (We have a 4-storey home; the ground floor has our office; I live on the 2nd floor; my daughter and her family live on the 3rd; and my father-in-law lives on the 4th. He likes the top floor because it guarantees he will get exercise when he comes down for dinner.)
<br>Most of the rest of the day is not so well scripted. I cook dinner 4 nights each week. I make sure that I stop working by 9 pm, and I do something meaningless (such as reading a novel, or watching replays of Game of Thrones, currently my favorite TV show).
</body></html>
What do you think of the TV show The Big Bang Theory?
<html><body>
<br>I’ve never been able to stick with it for more than 5 minutes for a simple reason: I hate programs that have a laugh track. Some character in the show makes some slightly humorous remark, and the hidden audience (I can only hear them) roars in laughter!
<br>I love the dry humor of a series such as Silicon Valley.
<br>Sorry if I spoiled The Big Bang Theory for you.
</body></html>
What do physicists think about the 2014 movie Interstellar?
<html><body>
<br>The scientific advisor for that movie was Kip Thorne, one of the most respected experts on cosmology and general relativity in the world. He was the coauthor of what many people consider to be the best book on the subject. (I consider it to be one of the three best books.) And Thorne did a great job of keeping all the physics within the realm of known physics or physics that we can’t rule out.
<br>Keep in mind that much of the physics in Interstellar is accurate (particularly the depiction of time dilation near the surface of the black hole) and that some of it was purely speculative. The movie doesn’t distinguish the two, so it is not a good source for learning physics.

What is a harsh reality new parents need to hear?
<html><body>
<br>Edit: I'm not interested in going around telling new parents a harsh reality. This is more of a reaction to questions about harsh realities.
<br>You have very limited control over what your child will become. It is very unlikely that he/she will be a little you, as much as you may want that. Your child will not fulfill your unaccomplished dreams. Try as you will, there is something new, something independent, something fresh and different in your child. You can guide, but you cannot steer.
<br>I think every parent who has had two or more children knows these truths. They discovered them when their children turned out to be so different from each other. So rather than think of this feature of parenthood as a harsh reality, take it as a joy. Your child will be different. Try to get to know him/her.

What is it like to have a beautiful wife?
<html><body>
<br>I am walking down the street, and I see a passing stranger looking at me, not at her. That used to surprise me. Then I figured it out.
<br>The stranger (whether man or woman) was looking at me wondering what did that guy do to deserve her?
</body></html>
What do professors think of slow learners in the classroom?
<html><body>
<br>A.k.a. slow, determined learners who doesn’t seem like they should be in your high level course but for some reason they made past the other courses
<br>When I was five years old, I played the role of the turtle in a play organized by my older sister. I had one line at the end, when I beat the sleeping rabbit to the finish line: slow and steady wins the race.
<br>I’ve always felt that those words guided my career. I was never the fastest; I was rarely an A student. But as the careers of others stalled, I kept going. My goal was always the same: to learn more this year than I had last year.
<br>When I see slow students, that’s what I think of. Are they future me’s? Are those the students who will keep learning over their entire lifetime, and leave the “quick” students far behind?
</body></html>
What controversial advice have people given to their children?
<html><body>
<br>“Follow your passion!”
<br>That is extremely common advice to youngsters, and in my opinion, very poor advice. In its place, I would say “Explore!”
<br>The problem is that children have been exposed to a tiny segment of the world; they don’t know what’s out there. When I was young, many children in the Bronx wished they could be either schoolteachers or medical doctors. Why? Because schoolteachers and doctors were the most educated and accomplished people they ever encountered. (In the south Bronx, where I grew up, being a “businessman” meant running the local grocery store.)
<br>The world is huge and full of wonder, and most children have seen only their neighborhood. I never met a scientist, not of any kind, until I took a physics class at Columbia. I did get to see some real businessmen when I got a summer job as a messenger down in the NYC Financial District, but I didn’t get a good sense of what they did.
<br>A good friend of mine encouraged her daughter to follow her passion, and she did: she became a professional bicycle racer. Of course, there is no income in that, and that means that it is extremely difficult for her to send her children to college. I know people who followed their passion into becoming ballet dancers. To earn a good living doing that you have to be in the top 100 in the country; this person now ekes out a living teaching young children to dance. That’s not a bad job, but it is not what she was hoping for when she followed her passion.
<br>I loved racquetball. But it is easy to play racquetball when I am a professional physicist. It would not be easy to play physics if I were a professional racquetballist. I chose well.
<br>I encourage children to get the best education they can. In college, defer picking your major as long as possible. Explore! Take classes in subject completely out of your field. (In my senior year, I took courses in sociology and Russian literature.) See what is out there. My wife Rosemary majored in math in college, graduated and became a systems engineer for IBM, and then quit her job to go back to school and become an architect. She loves that work, and has no interest in ever retiring. But how could she, as a child, have known that her joy would come from this (to her) obscure career. She never even met an architect until after she graduated from college.
<br>My daughter Elizabeth majored in math. When she was filling out the forms for graduation, she discovered that she had inadvertently fulfilled all the requirements for a major in literature; that wasn’t her intent—she had just been exploring. She took a job in Europe working for the OECD, something that was neither math or literature. Later she became involved in a start-up company in the UK, and finally she returned to the US where we set up the non-profit Berkeley Earth to study environmental problems. Was she following her passion? No—how could such a career have been conceived of by a youngster? She was exploring. She loves her work.
<br>Exploring is an adventure. It is full of uncertainty. It is much more challenging to explore than it is to follow your passion; there is much more uncertainty. If you feel that you must avoid all anxiety, then it is a very uncomfortable way to go. You live with doubt. It is not easy; in fact, it is full of wrong directions, and when you find yourself on a path that is not going where you want, you have to be ready to get off. (As my wife did when she quit IBM to go back to school.) But exploration is the only good way to learn enough about the world that you can discover the passions that you never knew you had.

How did you foil/dodge someone else's attempt to cheat or deceive you?
<html><body>
<br>My own example: 17 year old me sits for a New York street artist, loves the portrait, pays the shown price. Artist says no, the cardboard “frame” is suddenly $25, and mandatory. Showed my now-empty wallet, got my portrait… the rest of my cash was safely hidden in my sock. (full summary in comments)
<br>I was a teenager buying a ticket at the Cyclone, the classic wooden roller coaster at Coney Island. The ticket cost $1 (this was back in the 1960′s) and I gave the man a $5 bill. He counted out my change, and handed me the ticket and dollar bills. He slowly counted, “One, two, three, four.” That sounds right, doesn’t it? But the “one” was for the ticket. He paused. I waited. He paused. I looked him in the eye. Then he took one more one dollar bill, handed it to me, and said “five.”
<br>I’d bet that his trick worked on many teenagers.

What advice does Richard Muller have for an international student coming to study college in the United States?
<html><body>
<br>Make new friends among the Americans. Don’t hang out much with the students who came from your own country.
<br>When my daughter went to Paris for a year as a student, she was determined that she would not hear or speak a word of English while she was there. It was tough, and it meant she had to stay away from other US students. But the results were spectacular. Two years later she applied to graduate school in Paris at l’École Supérieure de Commerce, and the interview was in French. She was told that she sounded like a native Parisian; she was accepted at full scholarship.
<br>Integrate yourself to the US culture, for at least the time you are here.
</body></html>
What are some things instructors do on the first day of class to make a great impression on students?
<html><body>
<br>I wrote an email to every student in my class, over 500 of them, asking each one ten questions. Then I responded personally to each email. I had started doing this when the class was only 50 students, but over a few years the class had grown rapidly.
<br>The class was Physics 10, previously called “Qualitative Physics”, but I renamed it “Physics for Future Presidents”. My goal was to teach people who had avoided physics, and cover the most important topics, things they would be able to use if and when they became US president. Topics included energy, radioactivity, nuclear weapons, satellites, spying, global warming, …
<br>My lectures for the year 2006 were filmed and are currently available on YouTube. You can easily find them by going to YouTube and searching for “Physics for Future Presidents”. If you watch the lecture on relativity, you’ll see that I was already raising the issues and pondering the concepts that led eventually to my new theory of time, presented in some detail in my book Now: The Physics of Time.
<br>My wife thought I was crazy, spending all that time during the first week responding to so many emails. But I found it fun and relaxing and illuminating … and a good investment.
<br>My questions began with name, email address, major (or hoped for major), year in school. I asked for an emergency phone number; where do I call if I notice you are not present for a midterm. (I used this once, even in a huge class; it wasn’t me who noticed, but one of the student’s friends. She overslept, but answered her phone and ran to the class; I let her stay late to finish.)
<br>The higher numbered questions became more interesting. What do you do when you are not in class and not studying? (Lots of students answered, “I love to sleep.”) Do you engage in sports? (I got most of the Cal football team taking this class!) Why are you taking this class? What are you most interested in learning? What are you most worried about in signing up for this class?
<br>When I started doing this, the most frequent answer to “why are you taking this class” was “because a course in physical science is required, and Prof. Alex Filippenko’s class was full.” That was a genuine answer; Filippenko’s class was in Astronomy and it was famous; almost every year it was voted by the students to be the “Best Class on the Berkeley Campus.” In fact, I had talked to him to find out what he did that worked so well, and he was very helpful. I got a kind of perverse joy when, finally after years of improving the class, my class was voted best on the campus. Filippenko called to congratulate me, but I answered that he still deserved much of the credit, since my approach had been based on what he had showed me.
<br>I tried to personalize each answer. If a student was on a team, I made some comments about that team, maybe talked about what sports I liked (racquetball, skiing), or asked some question (such as “please explain offside to me in the sport of Rugby”). If the student liked music, I responded with the kind of music I listen to (mostly classical, but also the Beatles).
<br>The most intriguing answer I ever got was to the question “What are you most interested in learning?” The answer from one woman was “The physics of Nietzsche.” That totally confounded me. I had read some Nietzsche (he’s a very quotable writer), but I still had no idea what she was referring to. I looked up online to see what physics Nietzsche had done, and couldn’t find anything. So finally I gave up and wrote back to her, confessing my ignorance and failure, and asking her if she could be more specific.
<br>Her return answer was, “Oh, Professor, I’m so embarrassed. I couldn’t imagine that you were actually reading all 500 answers, so I just made a joke. I never figured you would actually read it!”
<br>Reading her reply, I knew I had won over at least one very difficult to reach student.

What did you do as a child that you hid from your parents?
<html><body>
<br>I remember one holiday when my two sisters and I crawled out to sit on our grandparents roof after the family all went to bed. What did you do that you hid from your parents?
<br>I mixed chemicals to make explosives.
<br>Once, at a physics department meeting I asked the other professors, “How many of you made gunpowder when you were a kid.” About ⅔ raised their hands.
<br>I found chemistry to be pretty boring, except for explosives. In New York City in the 1950s there was even a store that specialized in selling dangerous chemicals to youngsters. It was called “Wynn Chemical.” If you were under 13 you needed an adult to come with you. I recall waiting in line behind a young kid and his grandmother. When they got to the front he asked for “one ounce of potassium nitrate, one ounce of powdered charcoal, and one ounce of sulfur.” Those are the three ingredients in classical gunpowder, although the ratios are not 1:1:1. The salesclerk asked if the grandmother approved, and she did. He didn’t say a word about what the kid was obviously going to make. (And neither did I.) I doubt very much if the grandmother knew.
<br>At home, I would sit at my desk with a home-made scale (I used coins as weights) and mix the ingredients. Then I would put them on a piece of cardboard, attach a short fuse (those could also be bought at Wynn), open the window, put it all on the sill, light the fuse, and close the window. Then I would watch the flash and smoke and see how cleanly it all burned.
<br>One day, after I had been doing this, my mom came into the room. She said that a policeman had seen some smoke from my window (I was on the third floor of an apartment house, across the street from St. Mary’s Park) and was investigating. I knew I was dead. He came into my room and asked what I was doing. I told him I was doing chemistry experiments. He looked at me, and at my desk, and said, “Oh…” and then turned and left.
<br>I realized that what he thought he had seen was not an out-of-control teenager, but a boy genius, a young scientist, one of those types he had read about in the newspapers or seen depicted on TV. I knew better; I was just making gunpowder and other explosives. But I fit into a stereotype that was beyond his ken, and he seemed to be the one who was embarrassed. Through some miracle, I had survived the encounter. I was highly amused at the way I had survived.
<br>My mom seemed happy enough too. If the police (presumed to be experts) were satisfied, so was she.
<br>In high school, I had a friend who had an unhappy story. He was badly burned by an explosive experiment gone wrong, and his parents took away all his chemicals.
<br>Please don’t take my story as an excuse to make your own explosives or to encourage your children to do so. It is dangerous. And teenagers and preteens love to do dangerous things. Until they get hurt, they feel invulnerable. Take care.

How do successful people make long-term decisions?
<html><body>
<br>How patience works in this?
<br>My wife Rosemary came up with an approach that I have used over decades. (We celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary tomorrow.) The answer has two steps. It is important to use both steps, and not depend on just one or the other.
<br>Step 1. Start by making an elaborate list of all the important pluses and minuses. Best, put it on a spreadsheet. Determine the importance of each item, and compute the combination with the highest score.
<br>Step 2. Throw away the spreadsheet and make a seat-of-the-pants gut decision based on your intuition.
<br>Many people make the mistake of jumping right to step 2 without doing step 1. But if you do that, your gut will be unprepared. It will not know all of the issues, and your intuition will be unreliable.
<br>Many people make the mistake of doing step 1 and only step 1. It seems logical, maybe even scientific. The problem with that step is that you can’t really articulate what is important to you and what isn’t. Step 1 depends too much on your intellect, on what you think you should want.
<br>In the end, you must trust your instinct. But only after you have informed yourself of all the facts and all the analyses. You don’t really have to make a spreadsheet, but you’ve got to examine all the facts and think of all the pluses and minuses. Then let your instinct decide.
</body></html>
What are the types of people that you should always avoid?
<html><body>
<br>Sociopaths.
<br>These are people who have little or no sense of empathy; they don’t care if they hurt others, as long as their actions promote their own agenda. These are people who, when they see someone else in distress, really deep down don’t care.
<br>I had known such people for most of my life, but hadn’t truly recognized them until my sister (Ph.D. in psychology) gave me a book called The Sociopath Next Door (by Martha Stout). I highly recommend this book. Most people can name the famous sociopaths: Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and Putin. But it is very helpful to recognize the less well-known ones, the ones you come across daily in your personal life.
<br>Many sociopaths have learned to be sweet and to appear to be kind, but that is a mask for their inner standards. Doing so helps them exploit others. Several percent of the people you meet are thought to be sociopaths. The percentage may be higher among “successful” people, since there are some survival advantages to the syndrome. There are also disadvantages. One sociopath I know quite well won a Nobel Prize in physics (in part due to taking credit away from others), but despite that, nobody who has ever worked with him in the past will work with him again. Largely as a result, his post-Nobel career has completely stalled.
<br>These days, when I encounter a sociopath, I treat him (or her) with politeness, but I am careful to have no substantive relationship. I do not allow myself to depend on him in any way whatsoever, even if I think it is in his best interests to help me. Life is full of opportunities, and when you run across a sociopath, your best approach is to find a new path, one that avoids all interactions with that person.
<br>It is surprising that sociopaths exist? It may be a physical/medical/inherited condition, not easily cured through psychological counseling. I think the real miracle in life and civilization is that the vast majority of people do care about others. I don’t have the sense that this large scale empathy is shared by most of the members of the animal kingdom (outside of empathy for their immediate families and their providers; animal lovers will probably furiously disagree, but remember: I am allowing for pet empathy towards their providers.)
<br>Even in humans, empathy is sometimes limited to the tribe. Outsiders are not considered to be human. The most remarkable teaching of Plato and Jesus is that one should not only love one’s neighbors, but also one’s enemies. To the extent that we don’t do so, we are all somewhat sociopathic, if only a little. That should help us understand the true sociopaths. In effect, they consider all their colleagues and acquaintances (and often even their own family members) to be their enemies. How would you act if you were surrounded by enemies? Would you simply turn the other cheek?
</body></html>
What was your most rewarding moment as a professor/teacher?
<html><body>
<br>At the beginning of class, I always solicit questions, not only on the topic of the class, but on anything else. One student asked, “Professor, if you didn’t have to teach, would you still do so?”
<br>I was surprised at my own answer. I said “Yes. I currently spend half of my time doing research, and that is very stressful. My very best research ideas are those that nobody else thinks have value; they are so new and original that nobody else had them. The project might be too hard, or others don’t recognize its potential importance. Typically I then spend one to ten years developing the ideas, without getting much peer support. This is about as far from instant gratification as you can get. But in teaching, if you do a good job, you know it right away. You can feel it, and you see it in the faces of the students. So teaching and research are a perfect balance: one gives long-term results, and the other satisfies my need for immediate positive feedback.”
<br>Of course, I don’t remember my words exactly, but that is the gist of what I said.
<br>Even though I am now retired from teaching, I still give several guest lectures, including to a 4th grade class (taught by my sister Virginia) every year. I no longer give three lectures each week to 500 students, but I now substitute answering questions on Quora. I don’t see the smiles, but I get some very nice comments that give me almost instant gratification.
</body></html>
What was your funniest or most embarrassing blooper as a teacher/professor?
<html><body>
<br>I was demonstrating conservation of momentum by shooting a 22-caliber bullet into a block of wood. I missed, and the bullet went into the wall of the lecture room.
<br>For years afterwards, students apparently showed new students the hole in the plaster. I don’t lecture in that room any more and I don’t know if the hole has been fixed; maybe they still do.
</body></html>
Are mathematicians and theoretical physicists the most intelligent people in the world?
<html><body>
<br>The most intelligent people I know are not mathematicians or physicists, but businessmen and politicians. (Not all of them!)
<br>IQ exams are designed to test rapid abstract reasoning, very closely related to mathematical ability. People who score high on such tests are typically people with those skills, and those are the skills that can lead to careers in math and physics. So it is natural that physicists and mathematicians score high on the standard IQ tests, since they were developed to test math ability. That does not make them more intelligent than those who score low.
<br>The tests do not test many things. Among these are:
<br>1. Intelligence in understanding complex phenomena. (This is very important for business and military leaders and many others. How high do you think Warren Buffet’s intelligence is?)
<br>2. Musical intelligence. This is the kind displayed by Mozart. How did he know how to write music that we would want to listen to?
<br>3. Social intelligence. Important in almost every field; it often develops late. Can you read body language? Can you judge who is “solid” and reliable; who tells the truth; who fools you; who fools himself?
<br>4. Evaluation of real-time motion. Key for fighter pilots, nintendo players, and football and basketball players.
<br>5. Large picture intelligence. This is related to the complex phenomena aspect. It is exemplified by our greatest political leaders, those who not only had “vision” but could follow through on it.
<br>This list is just made off the top of my head by thinking about the numerous people I know who are not in math/physics but whom I consider to be more intelligent than I am. I could extend the list much farther, but this is long enough to make my point.

What is the smartest thing you have ever done under pressure?
<html><body>
<br>My wife was driving on a two lane highway. She pulled out to pass a bus, but the bus accelerated and we were only halfway past it when a truck appeared in our lane coming right at us. She desperately gasped, “Help! What can I do?!”
<br>I quickly but calmly said, “Step on the brake and go right.” She did it; we missed the back of the bus (probably because it was still accelerating) and the truck zoomed by on our left.
<br>Sometimes I imagine that we crashed, and God appeared and said, “You’ve been kind to other people. I’m going to give you another chance. My only rule is that you will not remember that this is actually a second chance.”
<br>Sometimes I have the feeling that I’ve had many such second chances in life.

What is the most satisfying passive-aggressive thing you have ever done to a really mean or rude person?
<html><body>
<br>Better if it's funny!
<br>I left a $1 tip for a $120 meal.
<br>It was a restaurant in New York City. I had taken my parents there to eat because of accounts of good food. The waiter was consistently rude every time I spoke to him (or tried to).
<br>The food was good, but the waiter managed to take much of the enjoyment out of the meal. My Mom suggested that I leave no tip. I said that if I were to do that, he might mistakenly think I had forgotten.
<br>I later learned that the restaurant was famous for the rudeness of its waiters. Apparently they considered that to be an attraction.

What happens if you wake up during surgery?
<html><body>
<br>Whenever possible, I ask to be allowed to stay awake during surgery.
<br>The most recent time I did this was after a mild heart attack. The surgeon wanted to install 4 stents, spreaders that keep the arteries of my heart wide open. To do this, they insert a tube into an artery in my arm and then they feed it up into my heart, while watching on ultrasound and then an X-ray machine. The surgeon said that if I wanted to remain awake, that would be OK with him. He would apply only local anesthetic.
<br>Indeed, I watched the whole procedure. The only negative was that the surgeon asked me to stop asking so many questions; I was distracting him.
<br>The evening after the surgery, I felt very good, and asked to go home. The nurse said I could not; not because of the cut in my arm, but because of the long effects of anesthesia; it would be dangerous if I got sick and, for example, vomited when my wound was still not healed.
<br>I told her that I did not have general anesthesia, only local. She seemed surprised, and with some degree of skepticism, checked my charts. “You’re right”, she said. “You can go home now if you wish, but we advise you to stay overnight.” I decided to leave (I hate hospitals). My wife was amazed and delighted.
<br>I had another similar experience with my dentist. For a long root-canal procedure, he asked me if I would be interested in trying nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, instead of local anesthesia. I was curious and gave it a try.
<br>It was a fascinating experience. I could feel the pain—and yet I didn’t mind the pain. (It reminded me of the famous scene in the movie “Lawrence of Arabia”.) I watched the dentist drill deeper and deeper, and several times motioned for him to move the mirror so I could watch better. During short breaks I asked him what he was going to do next.
<br>At the end he said to me that he has given nitrous oxide many times, but in every previous case the patient just drifted off into dreams. I was the only patient he had ever had who kept on asking questions when under laughing gas. I guess I just find real life far more interesting than dreams.

What is your most memorable cultural shock?
<html><body>
<br>I was in Shenzhen, China, and a family stopped me and my wife and asked us (my friend interpreted) if they could have their children take a photo with us. They were visitors from the interior of the country, and had never seen an American before.
<br>A similar thing happened in Shanghai. This time I was alone walking across the Waibaidu Bridge, and a group of teenage girls asked me (using sign language this time) if I could pose with them for a photo. I was happy to oblige, and I recall them all giggling as the photo was taken. (I wish I had a copy.)
<br>Another surprise: I was in Pudong (the newly rebuilt area of Shanghai) and I couldn’t find the entrance to the subway (a two stop line between Pudong and the Bund). I approached a man who was walking near me, showed him the ticket I had for the ride, and he nodded vigorously. Then he indicated I should follow. We went about 4 blocks; he pointed to the entrance, smiled, turned and walked away. I had no time to offer him a tip, which (in retrospect) was a good thing because it might have been taken as an insult. I couldn’t believe that he had taken so much trouble for a stranger.
<br>Again, similar experiences repeated themselves across China. The friendliness of the people, their courtesy, and their eagerness to help was wonderful. I don’t know if that classifies as “cultural shock” but it made me think about the US, and how I rarely experience such courtesy in my own country.

When was the first time you realized that a teacher cannot always be right?
<html><body>
<br>My teacher, I think in 7th grade, told us that negative numbers don’t “exist” but we should treat them in arithmetic as if they did.
<br>I recall thinking at the time that she was wrong. I thought to myself that negative numbers are like owing someone some money. Your wealth is negative.
<br>I’m convinced that half of the class stopped liking math at that time.
<br>It was later, I think in 9th grade, that a teacher told us that even though the square-root of −1 didn’t exist, we should pretend it does when we work out our algebra equations.
<br>I recall thinking back about negative numbers, and I decided that he was wrong too. Just as negative numbers lie outside of the collection of numbers I had used previously, so does the square-root of −1 lie outside of the numbers that I was used to. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t “exist”, any more than negative numbers don’t “exist”.
<br>But I know (from many discussions with students) that this was the point in which they felt math had moved beyond their abilities. If you have to work with things that are “imaginary” and not real then math wasn’t for them.
<br>For me, “imaginary numbers” are just as real as real numbers; they just have a bad name. They are not imaginary in the same way that the tooth fairy is imaginary; they are just “different” from the numbers that we (unfortunately) call the “real numbers”.
<br>Then in high school, my physics teacher drew a diagram of light going from a person’s head to a fish, showing how it bent when it passed through the surface of the water. Then he drew the backwards light path, but incorrectly! He claimed that the fish could see the man, but the man couldn’t see the fish. He was wrong! I wasn’t alone; half the class started arguing with him. This was at the Bronx High School of Science, and it shows that not all teachers at famous high schools are experts in the subjects they teach. The true value of the Bronx High School of Science was that the students were so good!
<br>The next year I took Chemistry, and the teacher told us that fallout from nuclear bombs was put there on purpose; that if they didn’t want fallout all they had to do was to remove the layer put there to make the fallout. I could’t believe that was true, and I went to her to argue. I had read about how many nuclear scientists said that the only way to avoid fallout was to never use the bomb; what she said didn’t seem consistent with what she was telling me.
<br>She got annoyed with me for not accepting her authority. She told me that she was the teacher and I was the student and I would have to accept what she said.
<br>That’s when I thought a marvelous thought, one that I still cherish. I thought to myself, “Someday I will have more impressive credentials than you have. And when I do, I’ll still believe that I am right about this question and that you are wrong.”
<br>Indeed, that came to pass. I got a Q clearance, and had the amazing experience of having Dick Garwin, the man who designed and directed the construction of the first hydrogen bomb (he did it at Edward Teller’s request) take me through the classified museum at Los Alamos and show me the detailed design and intricate functioning of all the parts of the hydrogen bombs (also called thermonuclear bombs; they are the ones that produce the dangerous fallout). And indeed my high school chemistry teacher was wrong, just as I had convinced myself decades earlier.

If it takes 8 minutes for light from the Sun to reach us, then why is it that when I open my eyes facing towards it, I see the Sun instantaneously?
<html><body>
<br>You are seeing the way the sun was 8 minutes ago. When you open your eyes and see something “instantanteously” you are not seeing it the way it is now, but the way it was then.
<br>If the sun exploded into a supernova 7 minutes ago (by the way… we don’t think this is possible) you wouldn’t know yet. Not a hint.
<br>When you open your eyes and look at your computer screen, you are (instantly?) seeing the way it looked about 1 to 2 nanoseconds ago — since light travels about 1 foot per nanosecond. (For a modern computer, that nanosecond represents 3 computer cycles; for modern electronics, it is not a long time.)
<br>When you instantaneously hear thunder from a flash of lightning that you saw 5 seconds earlier, you are hearing the sound that was emitted almost 5 seconds earlier.

How do you feel when someone is better than you/smarter than you?
<html><body>
<br>I feel intimidated. I feel stupid. I feel embarrassed. I feel uncomfortable.
<br>And this happens to me frequently. I suspect part of the reason for that is that I love to be in the company of people who are smarter than I am.
<br>I approached Luis Alvarez to be my supervisor for my Ph.D. work. At the time, it seemed that everyone in the Physics Department at Berkeley considered him to be the smartest person they had ever known. Years later Richard Feynman told me the same thing about him. So most of my time with Alvarez was one of awe and a strong feeling of inferiority. I consoled myself that even if I eventually learned just a little of what he knew, what he could do, it would be an enormously valuable eduction.
<br>One day I recall putting my hand to my head and pretending to turn a key. I called it my “ego key” and I had to turn it off in order to keep working with Alvarez. Forget ego; just learn everything I could possibly learn.
<br>I recall when I first joined JASON (Alvarez had nominated me) and I found myself working with dozens of people, every day during the summer, all of whom were vastly smarter than I was. They included Freeman Dyson, Dick Garwin, Steve Weinberg, Mal Ruderman, Walter Munk …. I remember the stress that being surrounded by such smart people triggered in me. But I took solace that I was in the most stimulating, learning enviroment that I could imagine. I knew it would be tough, but if I could survive, I would emerge as a much better scientist.
<br>I survived. I later learned that it was a member of the Jason group who nominated me for my MacArthur Prize. In my mind, every one of the other Jasons qualified for that prize. I was somewhat awestruck to discover that any other of Jason actually considered me to be smart.
<br>This habit of keeping myself surrounded by super smart people continues today. It has not gotten any easier, but it has remained extremely stimulating and a great way to learn at a very deep level.
<br>I’ve tried to teach my children (and now my grandchildren) not to avoid discomfort. All adventures are characterized by discomfort. I recall some of mine: being lost in a deep cave, backpacking off trail in snow and sleet with no prospect of shelter for the night, wandering around in Moscow, struggling to find a way to study the Big Bang, facing a steep slope in Squaw Valley, writing a book, being a member of Jason ….

What countries will you never visit again?
<html><body>
<br>Russia. I’ve been there four times, once for a scientific conference, and three times for discussion of arms control, and I find the Russian culture and art and people wonderful. Under the communist regime I always felt personally safe. Because of my security clearances, I sensed that the KGB kept me under surveillance (indeed, one time my wife was approached in an attempt to find out more about me). As a result, I felt secure; nobody could accost me without me getting off immediate defense from my KGB followers.
<br>But I’ve had a close friend, Dan Ford, who interacted with the Putin government, and was threatened with murder if he didn’t comply with their illegal demands. “We’ve learned that it would be cheaper to have you killed than to buy your shares” he was told.
<br>When Dan reported this to the FBI, they told him that such behavior had become common under the Putin regime, and that there was nothing they could do. They suggested that he give up ownership of the Russian company he had cofounded. He did, losing all of his substantial investment, but saving his own life.
<br>His story is very similar to that of Bill Browder, but in Browder’s case, his close colleagues actually were murdered. You can read his story in the book Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man's Fight for Justice, by Bill Browder. I highly recommend this book; it gives a remarkable insight into what is currently happening in Russia. I asked Browder if his book put his life in additional danger, and he told me that he hoped for the opposite. Now that he has gone public, it makes it much more difficult for Putin to simply kill him.
<br>If Putin and his kind of government is ever replaced, then I could imagine going back.

What's the point of an open book test?
<html><body>
<br>With an open book we are testing understanding rather than memory.
<br>When I teach physics for physics majors, the students vastly prefer open book. Physicists are typically good at analytics and poor at memorization. Give them the equations and the constants, and they can compute.
<br>When I teach my physics course for non-scientists, “Physics for Future Presidents”, I discovered that few students took the open book option. Students from English, History, Political Science, … are accustomed to memorization, and they don’t consider the small amount needed in physics to be a burden. So they opted for the longer time I generally allow for closed book exams.
<br>In many fields both memorization and understanding are useful. In my research, I never attempt to work without referring to books. On the other hand, when giving a seminar or colloquium, you can’t refer to a book when someone asks you a question.

Did Melania Trump's speechwriters plagiarize Michelle Obama's speech? If so, why?
<html><body>
<br>Melania Trump is 100% guilty—the fault can’t be blamed on her speech writers. Yet in a larger sense she is a victim, someone to be forgiven.
<br>Let’s not project our disdain for Donald on Melania. Like Donald, she is in a position for which she is woefully unprepared, but unlike Donald, she didn’t thrust herself into this position, but was thrust into it by her husband.
<br>I have come across many cases of plagiarism in my role as a professor at UC Berkeley. For 10 years I’ve asked students to “summarize” articles on science and technology that they find on the web. The problem is that they don’t understand what plagiarism is; they don’t know how to “rephrase” what they read, and when they try, they think it inadequate, so they copy the words more closely.
<br>Are they guilty of plagiarism? Yes, but it is (in my mind) the result of their inadequacy in writing. (Part of my goal is to develop them into being better writers.)
<br>Melania Trump was undoubtedly impressed by Michelle Obama’s speech, and she wanted to say many of the same things. She is not a speech writer, but she wanted to write the speech herself. So as she wrote it, she discovered that Michelle had said it better, and her own text drifted closer and closer to Michelle’s. She made a point of changing a word here and there to “avoid” any possible plagiarism. But as an inexperienced speech writer, she didn’t appreciate where to draw the line. She had the same problem that my students had.
<br>Should the reviewers of the speech have caught the plagiarism? That’s amazingly hard to do unless you are looking for plagiarism (as I do as a professor at Berkeley). It is not what someone expects in a political speech, and few writers review speeches from amateurs.
<br>I forgive Melania because I have seen so many students struggle with their desire to express ideas they have seen in great speakers, with no true concept for how to do that. We put potential spouses of presidential candidates in a very difficult, perhaps impossible position. They are expected to deliver a great speech, but unlike the candidate, they have little or no experience in this very difficult job. We should not expect them to be able to do that.
<br>What spouses should do is let the professional write their speeches.
<br>How much of Michelle Obama’s speech was written by her? Was the eloquence her own? It is a remarkably good speech for an amateur, so I assume that most of it was written by her speechwriters. Is it plagiarism to deliver a speech as your own and take credit for it when it was written by someone else, a ghostwriter who goes unacknowledged? In politics, we have decided that doing so is not plagiarism, although in my university, having your presentation be written by a ghostwriter would serve as good grounds for expulsion.
<br>The wonderful irony of this incident was pointed out to me by my daughter Elizabeth Muller. After the way Donald has railed against Obama, we discover that his wife Melania truly respects and admires Michelle Obama! I suspect that Michelle is a role-model for Melania. We could never have learned this more dramatically than through the speech Melania gave at the convention!

What is the creepiest phone call or voice message you've ever received?
<html><body>
<br>I got a message saying “I wouldn't drive tomorrow morning...lest you be blown to bits.” It had been sent the previous day, but I was reading it in the morning. Just as I got that message, I heard my wife starting the car outside. It did not blow up.
<br>It was an email threat, the third email I had received from that person. The Berkeley Police politely looked at it, and told me there was no way to trace it. So I asked my class if there were any hackers who might do better. (At that time I was teaching the class for physics majors and engineers.) After class, about six students came up to help. Indeed, they were able to trace the email, and I got the name of a registered student. I gave it to the police; they went to his apartment, he confessed, and he was arrested.
<br>I asked to meet with him, and against the strong advice of the police I did. I spoke to him, and learned that he did it because he thought I might be “vulnerable” (actually, because of my novel about Jesus!). He seemed to feel lost in the world, and doing things like that made him feel that he had some power over others.
<br>I asked him whom else he had threatened (remarkably, the police had not done that!), and he named another student, and then added, “and President Clinton.” So I told the police, and they contacted the other student, and the US Secret Service. The Secret Service came to investigate, and the perpetrator will be watched by them for the rest of his life. I did not press charges, and he did not go to prison.
<br>—-note added (after this answer drew much interest on Quora)—
<br>The incident happened in December 1996. I just dug out the old messages. It turns out that the worst threat was made by email. His “explanation” for the threat was my novel The Sins of Jesus (now available on Amazon Kindle). He signed the emails Haas Reject. (Haas is a business school at Berkeley; Physics H7B was the physics course I was teaching at the time.) Here are his emails:
<br>First email from Hass Reject: “ARE YOU AN ATHEIST, DR MULLER? WHAT KIND OF BLASPHEMY IS THIS???”
<br>Second email from Haas Reject: “HEY DICK, DON'T DARE YOU CHANGE THE SUBJECT! ANSWER MY QUESTION ON UCB.CLASS.PHYSICS7B! ARE YOU AN ATHEIST OR NOT? YES OR NO? FAILURE TO ANSWER AS SPECIFIED WILL LEAD TO DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES! GOT THAT?”
<br>Third email from Haas Reject: “I wouldn't drive tomorrow morning...lest you be blown to bits… fucker”
<br>Forgive the inclusion of the expletive, but that is what he wrote.
<br>These days the emails might be considered “hate mail” and they would draw attention from both the university and the police and even newspapers. But at the time it was only a death threat, not as serious as hate mail.
<br>Mr. Haas Reject made the mistake of using a campus computer. Not only that, but when he signed in to use it, he used his true name. We are fortunate that many people who break the law or otherwise try to do harm are so stupid.
<br>The university put the case to a student disciplinary council. In punishment for what he had done, they took away his campus computer privileges for a semester. I can’t make sense of that, except by thinking that they interpreted his threats as a practical joke, with no intention of doing real harm. I suspect he may be on the US government no-fly list.

What is the one habit that can transform your world forever?
<html><body>
<br>My mentor Luis Alvarez set aside an hour or two every Friday afternoon for thinking out of the box. He reviewed what he knew, with particular attention to what he had learned in the last week. He thought about all the outstanding problems he was aware of, and reviewed whether his new knowledge had any bearing. He didn’t restrict himself to being practical, but tried to open his imagination. He knew about major discoveries (and Nobel Prizes) that had been missed by him, by his father (who was a medical scientist), and by many others simply because they didn’t forget their daily cares for just an hour or two and think openly.
<br>I remember consciously doing this back in 1976. I had been working on a new approach to measuring trace elements, and realized I had not even tried to think about its wider implications. So I stopped and asked myself, what else could this be applied to?
<br>My very first thought, less than 20 seconds later, was radiocarbon dating. Could the method be used to detect single atoms of radiocarbon? If it could, then the sensitivity of radiocarbon dating could be increased by a factor of a thousand or more!
<br>I got excited but nervous when I found I could not rule the idea out. A few days later, I told Luis about it, and he also could find no flaws. In fact, it proved feasible. The next few months were hectic. My article on the idea was published less than a year later, in Science magazine, along with my successful test of the approach. I am proud that today almost all radiocarbon measurements are made using my method, now called AMS for Acclerator Mass Spectroscopy. See the Wikipedia article linked here: Accelerator mass spectrometry. The method is widely used in geophysics, in archeology, in history (it was used to determine the age of the Shroud of Turin) and in medicine—I wonder if I’ve saved any lives?
<br>I believe I would have missed the idea entirely if I had not consciously copied the habit I learned from Luis Alvarez, the habit of stopping work and attempting, consciously, to put together ideas that weren’t obviously related, but just might be.

What is the smartest thing you have ever done in exams?
<html><body>
<br>It was a graduate level exam in electromagnetism, taught by Professor William Chinowsky, based around the famous book by Jackson. The problems were tough. There wasn’t sufficient time to solve them all. Which ones should I do?
<br>Instead, I decided to write a paragraph on each problem describing how I would solve it if I had the time to do so. I laid out the assumptions, the relevant equations, showed that there were sufficient constraints to lead to the answer.
<br>I was surprised and delighted when the exams were returned to discover that Professor Chinowsky had given me about 75% credit on each problem. Everyone in the class had also been time-stressed, and as a result I got the highest score in the class.
<br>The next semester I asked Prof. Chinowsky for a letter of recommendation for a National Science Foundation fellowship. He probably only said that I was the best student in his class. I got the fellowship.
<br>A large part of examinship is knowing what the professor is looking for. I know another professor, Eyvind Wichmann, who would have given me a zero on each problem had he been grading that exam. And yet trying to figure out what the professor really wants is enormously valuable, not just to your final grade, but to your education. The professor is a professor for a reason, and he/she likely has a better understanding of what is needed for success in the field than you do.

I don't understand how proofs that [math]1=2[/math] are possible. This one seems credible. Can someone explain where it goes wrong?
<html><body>
<br>Start with:
<br>
<br>Factor it two ways:
<br>
<br>Divide both sides by
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>I don't understand...
<br>I have a simplified proof that 1 = 2 that sheds light on yours. I can write
<br>1 x 0 = 2 x 0
<br>since both sides are equal to zero. Cancel the 0’s to get:
<br>1 = 2
<br>Other proofs that 1 = 2 often use the same method but hide the division by zero in the algebra. In your example, it was when you divided by (x - x). My proof (unlike yours) is too blatantly obvious to make it into a good paradox, but its transparency is what makes it helpful to those who are mystified by the rule that you are not allowed to divide by zero, even in the form (x - x).
<br>Here’s a proof (from my upcoming book Now) that all number are equal to each other. (I like this because it generalizes the 1 = 2 proof, because the division by zero is well hidden, and in part, because I made it up when I was a teenager.)
<br>====quote from Now—The Physics of Time===
<br>Let A = 13, B = 13, C and D be any two numbers. Then
<br>A = B
<br>Multiply both sides by (C-D) to get
<br>A(C-D) = B(C-D)
<br>Expand:
<br>AC-AD = BC –BD
<br>Rearrange:
<br>AC-BC = AD-BD
<br>Factor:
<br>C(A-B) = D(A-B)
<br>Cancel (A-B) to get
<br>C = D
<br>Since C and D were arbitrary, I’ve proven that all numbers are equal.
<br>====end of from Now—The Physics of Time===
<br>Can you spot the division by zero? Note how I camouflaged it by using the word cancel instead of divide.

If Apple is really building an electric car, what does this mean for Tesla? Is Apple's product quality likely to be dramatically superior, and is there room in the market for both Tesla and Apple?
<html><body>
<br>I don’t think there is room in the market for either Tesla or Apple. I predict that the electric cars are a fad that will fade.
<br>Let me warn you—whenever I write about electric cars I draw furious and angry responses from many people. It is remarkable how deep is the love of the electric car concept, and how many people consider my view to be blasphemy! Many people will argue that I am wrong, or don’t have any vision. I respond by saying that the proponents of electric cars show “optimism bias.” That is, they believe that the serious problems inherent in electric cars will be solved, yet they choose to be pessimistic about similar improvements in gasoline cars (e.g. 100 mpg gas mileage, which are well within the technology).
<br>The batteries are too expensive, and not decreasing rapidly in price. The expense of running such a car comes from the battery replacement cost, which happens after 500 to 1000 full recharges. (Tesla builds in a one-time replacement cost into their initial high price to cover this issue. That keeps the initial cost high.) There is little to no environmental benefit, since in most of the world the electricity is derived from coal. An electric car in China produces more CO2 than does a gasoline car.
<br>It is amazing how the public continues to venerate the “success” of Tesla, even though they have continually shown no profit. (The old joke is that they lose money on every car, but will make up for that in volume.) Tesla continues to produce overly-expensive cars purchased largely by two categories of customers: the most wealthy people in the US (who get admiration for going electric!) and to techie nerds who love the technology and are willing to devote a large fraction of their income to their love. They also appeal to people who mistakenly think that such cars are a big benefit to the environment.
<br>I think we are observing a Ponzi scheme in which companies like Tesla continue to grow because the early investors made money — but only because later investors came in. That will stop, and then the fad will collapse. The subsidies are soon to end. When that happens, and the fad goes away, the electric car enthusiasts have their answer ready: they were driven out of the market by the unexpected and environmentally harmful drop in the price of oil and gas. They will blame the demise of the electric car, once again, on the oil and gas industry.
<br>Why is Apple interested? They are a huge company with loads of capital, and it is worthwhile putting a modest investment into something that appears to be failing, just in case that prognosis turns out to be wrong. I am not an enthusiast about autonomous vehicles; I expect the technology will be implemented incrementally to help us drive (just as “cruise control” was introduced but never widely used). Yet the autonomous aspect is, in my judgement, far more likely to have a long term benefit than the all electric aspect.
<br>I am a real enthusiast for hybrid automobiles, cars that use electricity only for those short moments when it provides a true benefit. I think the hybrid car will be widespread.
<br>My detailed arguments against the all electric car appear in my book “Energy for Future Presidents.” It is a little out-of-date now, but basically still accurate. Prices of batteries have come down, but not nearly enough to negate the high cost of owning such a car. Of all the controversial things I say in that book, the only topic that draws hate-mail is my discussion of the electric car. Love of the electric car is passionate and almost religious.

What is the most soul-satisfying thing you have ever done in your life?
<html><body>
<br>There are times when you do something for someone or for your self. You feel contented and peace within you
<br>My mentor, the great Nobel Laureate Luis Alvarez was dying of cancer, but I could tell that he was more concerned about his mental state. I assured him his wits were all there, but he had watched his dad suffer from Alzheimers, and he didn’t seem convinced.
<br>Then I stumbled upon a small optical device, a display that used an array of tiny lenses to produce a wonderful and beautiful Moire pattern. That was all I could figure out about it; just exactly how did it really work? I knew that Alvarez had an enormous understanding of classical optics, and he loved the subject.
<br>So I brought him the device, told him about my Moire thoughts, but expressed my confusion. He took it from my hand, examined it, showed fascination, puzzlement, and said he would think about it. I left it with him.
<br>Two days later I visited again, and he proudly explained to me how it worked. I was delighted, but (I think) not as delighted as he was.
<br>He knew the problem was challenging; he knew I had tried and failed to understand it. He had figured out its clever and non-intuitive design. Nothing less than that could have convinced him that his mental abilities were undiminished.
<br>I still take pleasure in my memory of the joy that brought to him.
<br>(I’ve had some other soul-satisfying experiences, but of the more conventional kind. This one struck me as unusual and perhaps different from the other answers to this question.)

Who are the most unfortunate scientists of all time?
<html><body>
<br>Ludwig Boltzmann. He founded the modern theory of atoms, put the theory of heat on a fundamental foundation, and explained the deep meaning of entropy; but his great achievements weren’t believed. He argued that pressure was just the result of numerous gas particles constantly bombarding a surface, and that heat was not a separate fluid, but just the vibration and random motion of molecules.
<br>But, like Cassandra, he was not believed in his own time (with some significant exceptions, including Einstein). He spent “nearly four decades … defending his theories of statistical physics. He suffered from what we now call bipolar disorder, and in 1906, during a fit of depression, he hanged himself, just three years before Perrin’s experiments [on Brownian motion] convinced the physics world that the basic assumptions of his work were right.” (Quote taken from Now: The Physics of Time.)
<br>Before he died, he asked to have his equation for entropy (S = k log W) engraved on his tombstone. The constant “k”, now called Boltzmann’s constant, is one of the most important numbers in all of physics, considered by professional physicists to be in the same category of importance as the speed of light c and Planck’s constant h.
<br>I refer you also to Dragos Serban's answer. He also named Boltzmann, but I didn’t see his post until I added mine. He fills in some interesting details.
<br>Boltzmann’s tombstone request was granted. I attach a photo.
<br>This tombstone reminds me of the famous tombstone of Archimedes. He asked to have a sphere surrounded by a cylinder put on his tombstone. That’s because that diagram was what enabled him to make what he considered to be his greatest mathematical achievement: deriving a formula for the surface area and volume of a sphere. Many years later, Cicero searched for the tomb of Archimedes, and knew he had found it when he saw one with the sphere/cylinder mounted on it. (See, for example, Tomb of Archimedes.) Of course Archimedes was also unlucky, having been killed by a Roman soldier (see the account by Livius) when Archimedes refused to stop his work and pay due respect.

Given 5,000 years and plenty of resources, do you think science will be able to grant humans immortality?
<html><body>
<br>I’m guessing we will outlaw immortality. I suspect that death from old age is not necessarily a failure of nature, but a great invention. We will recognize that nature invented old age for a reason, and it would be unwise to undo that natural process.
<br>Many animals don’t die of old age, such as paramecia. You can argue that the original paramecium is still alive today. It has split many times, basically cloned itself, and some of those clones have died, from attack by other animalcules and from environmental causes, but not from old age.
<br>In a similar sense, we don’t die. Part of our bodies goes on, in the form of our children. We don’t split in a way exactly similar to the paramecium, but we do divide (at least women do) partially, and the result is the child.
<br>Why did nature invent old age? I think it probably has to do with the optimum use of learning versus invention. As we get older, and we accumulate knowledge, we have a very powerful advantage over the younger people. But knowledge and experience can get in the way of new invention. Somewhere along the line, nature discovered that the species does better if the old, educated, wise, but perhaps a bit stodgy creatures are simply removed, giving space and opportunity for the young and creative. If not for old age, there never would have been a tenure spot for me at Cal; and indeed, without my old age, there would never be a new one for a younger person.
<br>Please don’t be depressed by these thoughts. Take joy in them. Death is a part of life, but life does go on. Look at your children, or the children of others, and imagine the great big beautiful tomorrow coming at the end of every day. (Quote from 1964 World’s Fair, which I attended, now repeated at Disneyland.) You won’t be there, but they will. They come from you; they are a part of you. Do what you can do in life to make their lives better. Be productive during your limited years. If there is a purpose in life, that is it.
<br>I was once asked in an interview whether I would prefer to be conscious when I died, or do so in my sleep. I responded that I wanted to be conscious. I would not want to miss that once-in-a-lifetime experience.

How does the earth orbit the sun without losing energy?
<html><body>
<br>What provides the earth with the energy to perform orbital motion with a constant velocity? Wont small atomic particles eventually stop it?
<br>Physics is hard to understand because it violates everyday observation, intuition, and common sense.
<br>Take “Newton’s First Law” as an example. It states that an object in motion tends to stay in motion unless influenced by an outside force. This violates everyday experience. Things in motion tend to stop! Push a small object (coin, pen, cup) across a table; it doesn’t tend to stay in motion. It stops. Throw a ball and it stops. Everything stops. It takes a lot of study to truly understand Newton’s First Law, because it disagrees with what we observe every day. Of course, it doesn’t really disagree, because friction is supplying the force. But friction is hard to calculate. That’s what makes physics hard.
<br>In fact, physics was discovered by looking at things where friction is small or negligible, such as the orbits of planets, and heavy falling spherical-like objects. Newton realized that the Moon was falling, falling around the Earth due to the same force that makes an apple fall.
<br>When we do physics demonstrations in class, we buy expensive apparatus for which friction is virtually absent, such as masses suspended on air bearings. We need to do this because the simple equations of physics work only in such circumstances.
<br>Physicists are generally uncomfortable with friction. You have a mechanical problem that involves friction? You should probably speak to an engineer, not a physicist. Engineers work with friction all the time. Physicists avoid it. Look at any physics text for the chapters on friction. Typically you’ll see a short mention in the book for freshman, and then very little after that.
<br>Physics works best when there is no friction. The two most important examples: space, and the atom. In between, it is hard to do physics because friction can only be modeled approximately.
<br>Now with all that introduction, the answer to your question: out in space the vacuum is so high that friction is negligible. That’s why the Earth orbits without losing energy. There is nothing for it to give its energy to.
<br>(There are many good posted answers to this question; I’m giving mine because it is somewhat different from the others, and I think it might address the issue that bothers many people.)

Why are some very smart people so quiet?
<html><body>
</body></html>
What's going on with Donald Trump? What did he do?
<html><body>
<br>Many people in the United States (and around the world) believe that it takes no particular skill or knowledge to be President of the United States, or the head of any government. These are people who believe that intuition and feeling is more important than expertise.
<br>(As I have before, I strongly recommend Alan Cromer’s great book, Uncommon Sense in which he describes in some detail the dramatically different ways that people approach problems.)
<br>These people have a sense that the entire system is corrupt, and that running the government consists of making decisions based on common sense. If extra information is necessary, then the President can solicit it from specialists. Why would the President need to know the difference between Sunni and Shiite, when he can always ask? Why would the president need to know the difference between fusion and fission, or the meaning of the nuclear “triad”, when he can have experts at his beck and call? What is most needed is someone who feels and thinks like you do, and who can be trusted.
<br>Can he be trusted? Well, let’s give him 4 years and see. If he turns out to be corrupt as everyone else, then we can throw him out. It’s worth the risk.
<br>For many such people, Donald Trump seems to be ideal. They like the way that he speaks his mind; they like his self confidence, and even his arrogance. He does not put up with insult or slights; he gives back more than he gets. In many ways, he appears to be a common man who has been successful, and (since no skill or knowledge is needed) will be the perfect person to put in charge.
<br>People who feel this way will not be persuaded by arguments that Trump is unprepared, since they don’t think preparation is necessary. Deep down, they think that they themselves could be a good President. All it really takes is a degree of honesty, and a refusal to be corrupt; an ability to ignore the bribes and the lobbyists and to simply do the right thing. The people who run for office do so from a combination of luck and corruption; maybe because they knew the right people. It’s not what you know, but who you know. [grammatical error made purposefully]
<br>I grew up surrounded by such people in the South Bronx. They read the New York Daily News, and saw in it a common sense that they shared. The world is simple but corrupt; let’s put someone in charge who will not be beholden to special interests.
<br>Think about this when you talk to Trump supporters. Arguments that Trump is not qualified seem irrelevant to them. They distrust “policy” as a kind of alien religion; just do what is right, and you can tell what is right by trusting your instincts.
<br>If you are an intellectual, or someone who thinks either that Trumps policies are misguided, or that Trump actually has no policies, or someone who thinks Trump gets his facts wrong, you will be very hard put to change the minds of any Trump supporter. Such people think differently than you do. The essence of character and experience that you consider essential, they regard as irrelevant.
<br>I think this is why Trump has been so immune to the standard objections that could destroy the political careers of conventional politicians. Many people find him attractive; they see him as someone who approaches national and international issues with the same intuitive approach that they take, and they find that comforting.

A person stops you at gunpoint and demands you hand over your wallet. How would you get the mugger to walk away using only the power of words?
<html><body>
<br>I note that there are no responses to this question from people who were killed by the mugger. In physics, we would say that the sample of people who answered reflect a strong observational bias. Each response from someone who was mugged and survived shows what worked at least once. That same answer may have failed 99% of the time, and we would not know it.

Would a knife blade that was one atom thick slice things truly effortlessly?
<html><body>
<br>[Question merged with others asking about one atom thick blades/wires touching food/people]
<br>I once made such a knife; I electrochemically etched the edge of a very thin piece of tungsten and it made a very sharp edge. A colleague of mine was often relaxing by sharpening his pocket knife, and I challenged him to a test. His best knife vs my etched tungsten. We didn’t try it on fruit, but rather on the edge of a thin piece of paper. He conceded; my etched edge was sharper than his best knife.
<br>Of course, only the edge was sharp, and it was supported by a wedge of metal behind it. And that very thin edge didn’t wear well. I took some scanning-electron microscope photos of it, and it appeared to be several atoms thick, not just one. But it was marvelously sharp.
<br>I recall the first time I got a paper cut. I was shocked that gentle, flexible, soft paper could make such a painful cut! (I think I was probably 7 years old.)
<br>Aluminum foil is about 1/10 the thickness of paper—and yet you don’t get aluminum foil cuts. The reason is that as the material gets thinner, even if it is made out of metal (aluminum is much stiffer than paper!), it tends to bend when it enters, and so the force from behind is not conveyed to the sharp edge.
<br>The problem is that the atoms on the end of the knife will stick to the fruit atoms almost as strongly as they stick to the knife atoms. At best, they will deflect; at worst, they will break off. It will be impossible to convey a force to them from the one-dimensional support of the knife atoms behind them.

Can hard work beat intelligence?
<html><body>
<br>Can hard work beat intelligence? Always!
<br>“Intelligence” measured by IQ is a ridiculously over-rated parameter. I’m constantly meeting people who are clearly more intelligent than I am (in the IQ sense) who have had frustrating and non-productive lives.
<br>Off the top of my memory, I can’t think of a single highly-intelligent individual who was successful without very hard work. And I can think of many who would score low on a standard IQ test who have been very successful.
<br>IQ measures a very narrow form of ability, typically the ability to think abstractly and solve abstract problems. Of course, there are many other forms of intelligence too: intelligence in evaluating people; intelligence in music; intelligence in understanding complexity; real-time intelligence (used in video games and fast-action sports). Most of these are ignored by the usual IQ test.
<br>But few people have multi-dimensional intelligence, and they must make up for that by hard work. By hard work I don’t mean putting in lots of hours. I mean using your intelligence (yet another kind!) to organize and run your life.
<br>The most productive people in the world combine multi-dimensional intelligence (abstract, people, complex data, real-time) with very hard work.

What are some odd or generally unknown facts about outer space?
<html><body>
<br>Space has a temperature, 2.7 degrees C above absolute zero. Anything colder than that will be warmed by the microwave bath. These microwaves pervade space; there is no place that is empty. (Of course, this is based on our current understanding, not on distant measurements!) The density of microwave photons is about 10 million per cubic centimeter. That is everywhere in the universe. They are remnants from the hot big bang.

Has Richard Muller died or been kidnapped, he hasn't been posting for a while?
<html><body>
<br>I apologize for my Quora absence, although I am pleased that I was missed. In the last few weeks I have been incredibly busy on several topics.
<br>This morning there was a break for me in these activities. What to do? Oh, Quora! So I came back to look, to learn, and perhaps answer a few questions.
</body></html>
Richard Muller: Why do you talk badly about Donald Trump but not Hillary Clinton as well?
<html><body>
<br>I have positive and negative feelings about many politicians, and I have a general policy of not discussing them publicly. My students were never able to figure out whether I voted Democrat, Republican, Independent, or anything else. I feel that I am most effective when I separate the knowledge I have from my political feelings.
<br>I have made an exception with Donald Trump only because he is so far removed from being an acceptable president, that he is a true statistical outlier. In fact, although I have strong political preferences, I think most people who become serious candidates for the office would be acceptable, even if not my top choice. In Donald Trump I see the first serious candidate ever who I think would be very harmful to United States interests in that office, largely because he knows so little about world and US affairs, and yet doesn't seem to recognize that he is so ignorant.

What do physicists know that lets them win at casinos?
<html><body>
<br>My physicists teacher once told us that when he went to Vegas, he won a lot, such that he was asked to leave the casino. He is also a programmer. How could this be possible?
<br>A colleague of mine built a device that enabled him to beat the roulette table. Impossible you may think, but no; it was based on physics.
<br>It worked as follows: to encourage people to bet at roulette, it has been traditional to allow bets to be made after the wheel is spun and the ball is flung, but only before it begins to drop. In that second or two, there is enough information to allow a measurement and computation that will, for example, double your odds of winning. If the computation simply rules out half of the wheel as unlikely, then the odds jump up highly in your favor. Whereas before, your odds of winning might be 98:100 (so you lose), if you exclude half of the numbers, your odds become 196:100; you win big!
<br>You don't have to predict the number where it will fall. You only have to increase your odds by 3% to go from losing on average to winning on average.
<br>He built a device with a switch for his toe in which he tapped each time the ball spun around; with a separate switch he tapped each time the wheel turned. This provided enough information for his small pocket computer to signal him back (with a tap to his leg) where he should place his bet. (He had to calibrate each wheel, but he did that by watching and testing before he started betting.)
<br>The casinos don't have the right to search you, so how can they guard against devices such as that? To do that, they have lobbied to make a law that they can exclude any person without cause. They choose to do that only when they see someone consistently beating the odds.  They can't get their money back, but they can stop losing.
<br>Indeed, my friend (who was then a gradate student at Berkeley) was put on the list. His name and photo were shared by all the casinos in Nevada (and maybe world-wide), and his gambling for profit career was at an end.  He says he almost made enough money to pay for the roulette wheel he had purchased to perfect his instrument at home before going out "into the field."

What is the best thing that ever happened to you for being nice?
<html><body>
<br>People love to complain over good deeds backfiring, or to say that being nice doesn't pay. I know that doing nice things makes the world a better place, and makes nice people have better lives. What is something great that happened to you because you were nice?
<br>I don't know if this is the best thing, but I'm guessing it will be a unique answer on Quora. I was chatting with a stranger at a party; he was very curious about physics. It was time to sit down and eat, and several of my friends urged me to take a seat with them; but there was only one seat. I thought it would be rude to leave my conversation, so I declined and sat with the stranger I had been talking to.
<br>We continued to talk through the lunch. Then, at the end, he said, "I assume you get all the financial support you need from the federal government." I said no; because my kind of research was typically in fields that they didn't support. He continued, "I run a small family foundation. Could we help support your research?" That was 15 years ago, and his foundation has given us substantial help every year.

Do professors mind if students eat in their class?
<html><body>
<br>I don't mind if they eat, as long as there is no associated sound or smell. If there is, then they are distracting other students. So I came up with a rule for my class: if another student can hear or smell your food, then you are obliged to share it with that student upon request. (Just seeing the food is not enough.)
<br>That cut the eating of food in class to near zero.
</body></html>
What is the single most effective piece of financial advice you've ever received?
<html><body>
<br>Don't compete with people who are better at the business than you are.
<br>When I was a beginning physicist, I invested in the stock market. Initially I did very well; I now attribute that to luck. I began to think I knew something that others didn't. It is easy to think you are smarter than you really are.
<br>When things went badly for me in the market, a friend explained that I was up against professional investors. He asked me to imagine a random person competing with me in a physics question.  Suppose some stock broker had to solve a physics problem, in competition with me. How would he do?  The answer was obvious: the stock broker would do miserably. 
<br>But here I was investing casually in a market in which very very smart full-time professionals are trying to make money. Perhaps if I devoted myself full-time to the stock market, I could do better than they could. But if it was only part-time; if I did only casual homework, reading about companies in the newspapers rather than visiting them and making deep evaluations … then I was competing with true experts.
<br>Some people think that the stock market is not a zero-sum game, that all can win. Yet in every trade, one person buys and the other person sells; they can't both be winning on an objective scale. 
<br>So the true experts need to have someone to supply all the money that they make at their profession. By investing in the stock market, I was playing that role; I was one of the people who was supplying the money that would make the true professionals rich.
<br>I decide to stop investing in things I didn't master, and to simply work harder at something in which I knew I had talent, physics. I think this was a very important decision for me.  Go with your strengths.

How do I make close friends in my early 30s? And not just acquaintances? (I'm female if that's relevant)
<html><body>
<br>It seems hard to make friends at this age, especially when having a biography different from most people (I don't have a partner or kids or a great career due to health issues) For example I'm volunteering in a passion project where I meet lots of people, but the relationships remain 'work'/shallow.
<br>I developed a trick. Here's a common situation: I am very busy, with something I need to get done in the next two hours. Someone I know sees me and says, "Hey Rich, how about getting a cup of coffee with me?"  My prior answer used to be, "Can't. I've got to get this done."
<br>No longer. Now I have a standard answer: "Sure."
<br>In retrospect, the urgent thing I needed to get done was almost never really urgent. That amazes me.  I had simply been putting work ahead of friendship.
<br>I came across an aphorism that encapsulates this: "Never let the merely urgent get in the way of the truly important." I love that phrase, "merely urgent"!  (Nobody really knows who first articulated this thought, but it is a good guide to living your life well.)
<br>I believe the key to friendship is spending unstructured time with people. Discussing business over coffee doesn't count. Taking a hike to discuss business does count, because in my experience a two hour hike rarely consists of more than 30 minutes of serious business; the rest of the time you are talking about things that don't really matter. And those conversations often drift, naturally, into discussions that do matter. And then you are at the beginning of a formation of a new true friendship.

has no solutions for integers a, b, c when n is an integer greater than 2.
<br>Of course, virtually all mathematicians I know believe that Fermat's unwritten proof must have been mistaken. That belief is based on the fact that zillions (that's a math term) of really smart mathematicians have tried to prove his last theorem for hundreds of years, and although it is now proven, none of them managed to come up with a proof that anyone would call simple. 
<br>Only Fermat knows for sure.

Does every American leave their parents’ house when they grow up?
<html><body>
<br>No, although doing so seems to be a part of a standard American culture. I had the opposite problem. When my wife and I had children, we desperately wished that our parents would move in with us, or live close by. We thought having children grow up in the presence of their grandparents would be wonderful; moreover, there was nobody in the world whom I would trust more to take occasional care of my kids.
<br>My mom refused. She did not like the "interference" of her mother-in-law, and when she was young, she promised herself that she would never move close to her children.
<br>It was hard, but we finally convinced her to break that promise.  At first she moved three blocks away from us (that was part of the way we persuaded her), but she and my dad finally moved into our (large) home.  It was the beginning of a wonderful experience, an extended family that really worked. They eventually died, but their influence on my children was wonderful.  Now my daughter (and her husband) lives with us in our (large) house.  I laid down the law, however, and told her that I would refuse to babysit more than 7 nights each week.
<br>As a Christmas present, my daughter gave me a certificate that would allow me extra babysitting days. I used them to take my granddaughter to the San Francisco Exploratorium, the greatest physics museum in the world. 
<br>About 4 years ago, my wife's dad moved in with us. He just celebrated his 95th birthday. It is wonderful that his great-grandchildren see him every day. And I think that thanks to them, he will likely be with us for a good and long time into the future.
<br>I think the American custom of maximal separation of parents from adult children is a sad and counterproductive tradition. Perhaps it helped the rapid expansion of the US economy, but I think all individuals should recognize it as an unusual custom not shared around the world, and breaking this tradition can be wonderful for families.

What is the most surprising declassified secret?
<html><body>
<br>If you looked up "the secret of the hydrogen bomb" a while ago, you would have found it described in many books and in the paper encyclopedias that still existed back then. But it was wrong! That's what surprised most people.
<br>The "secret" that was so widely published was that the hydrogen bomb used lithium-deuteride in place of hydrogen. When the bomb exploded, the lithium was converted to tritium, and the fusion took place as a tritium-deuterium interaction.
<br>So why did they insist on keeping a secret secret, when it was well known?
<br>Well, the true secret was totally different. It had to do with the use of gamma rays generated by the primary fission component, to compress the secondary (which did contain lithium-deuteride) and trigger the fusion faster than the blast from the primary would destroy it.  This secret was successfully kept until it was declassified a few years ago.
<br>A very powerful way to keep a secret is to allow misinformation to spread. Few people were trying to uncover the secret of the hydrogen bomb because they thought they already knew it.  But people trying to build such a bomb would have found that it would fizzle, because they had not properly implemented the true secret.
<br>The British managed to keep the secret of radar secret for many months, maybe for a year, by spreading the false rumor that their secret method for detecting enemy planes was to feed their pilots lots of carrots, and that enhanced their night vision.  It is false that eating carrots enhances night vision (although eating carotene can prevent night blindness, a vitamin deficiency). The secret was finally revealed to the Germans when they shot down some British planes carrying radar; but it is possible that it was the carrot deception that saved Britain.
<br>And it may be that same deception, never fully retracted in the mind of the public, that caused your mom to tell you to eat carrots "because they are good for your eyes."

Why do parents make their children eat things they don't like?
<html><body>
<br>Parents typically don't realize that food tastes different to a child than it does to an adult. So they don't realize the discomfort that a food might cause. Children are much more sensitive to strong flavors; part of the reason why adults tend to like mustard and hot sauce is because their taste buds have become less sensitive.
<br>I recall as a child thinking it was silly that other children wouldn't eat spinach, so I sat down determined to scarf it down. After one mouthful I gagged; there was something in that spinach that reacted violently with my digestive system. I couldn't eat any more. My parents didn't understand (but fortunately, they only chided me; they didn't force me to eat). Now, as an adult, I no longer have this reflex, and I love the flavor of spinach. But it is my body that changed, not the spinach, and not my "likes and dislikes". If I still gagged, I would still refuse to eat spinach.
<br>I think the right "trick" for a parent is to find healthy food that children love. That's not so hard to do, and the main problem is that adults find it to be "bland" (like macaroni and cheese). That means separate foods. But if your goal is to get good nourishment into your child, then it is a worthwhile thing to do. And, in my experience, it is not very hard; children enjoy simple foods, and sometimes surprising foods. My granddaughter particularly loves broccoli. My grandson much prefers couscous to french-fries.

How do I become a morning person?
<html><body>
<br>Set your watch to a different time zone.
<br>I knew a student at Berkeley who needed to be alert for an 8 am class. He told me that there was no way he could get up that early.  I suggested he set his watch to east-coast time. That way the class would start at 11 am EST; he could even sleep in late and still make it.
<br>To my amazement, when I saw him a few months later, he told me the method had worked wonderfully! He showed me his watch. It was three hours later than mine.
<br>Of course, the trick is that he was going to bed at midnight Eastern time, but that was 9 pm on the west coast.
<br>This illustrates the principle that your internal clock is very adjustable; it is not completely determined by the times of sunrise and sunset (which do change a lot from summer to winter in the temperate zone). More than anything else, your internal clock is set by the time that you go to bed, and the time you wake up. People suffer "jet lag" but they do get over it.
<br>I've used this trick in preparation to traveling to Kenya, where the time difference was 11 hours compared to Berkeley. I wanted to be fully alert when I arrived; I did not want to lose several days adjusting to the time zone.  I began two weeks ahead, and slowly changed my watch, the times I got up, my meals, everything else. It worked. When I arrived in Kenya, I felt fully adjusted.

How do you know that you have become an adult?
<html><body>
<br>When you finally understand the concept of "wisdom." It eluded me as a kid, and I just lumped it in with a bunch of other "myths", ways grown-ups have of putting down the ideas of youth.
<br>I was in my 20s. I recall being in a car and discussing some subject with an older engineer whom I really admired; his name was Robbie Smits. I don't remember what we were talking about, but I had this sudden realization that he was wiser than I was. It was like a lightning bolt. I hadn't really understood wisdom before, but I had just experienced it.
<br>Even today I continually notice people saying things that demonstrate they are wiser than I am. I try to learn from it every time I witness it. There are some amazingly wise people who have not taken advanced career paths, but who are the right people to discuss issues of life, love, choices, behavior, ethics, compassion, and the meaning of life.

Should I vote for Trump because at the very least he won't be corrupt?
<html><body>
<br>He seems to have strong morals, within his own opinions, and I really can't see a liar in him. I seriously doubt anyone could ever imagine that man involved in a corruption scandal. He always speaks out of his mind. I don't think I could ever feel the same about Hillary, let alone red Sanders.
<br>Donald Trump has repeatedly bragged that although his clients went bankrupt, that he himself never did.  Without disputing that claim (and people do), think about it. If Trump were your President, then you would be his client.

Do professors get irritated when students who don't attend lectures do really well in their classes?
<html><body>
<br>No. What irritates me is when the students having a hard time in the class don't attend. They are the ones who need the lectures.
<br>Yes, the top students need the lectures too; there is a lot more to learn than what it takes to earn an A. But students are overwhelmed with work. A typical undergraduate is taking too many courses, too many to devote full time to each. If they can get an A while scrimping on one course, that is probably the right thing to do -- as long as they use that time for something important, such as studying for another class, or sleeping.

What are common mistakes in friendships nobody tells you about?
<html><body>
<br>You've got to be there when your friend needs you.
<br>You've got to sense when your friend is almost desperate, and do whatever it takes to help. Sometimes it is lending a little bit of money; other times it is giving emotional support; sometimes it is doing something, something bothersome to you but valuable to the friend (babysitting on a key day? Taking him to the hospital? Going with him to some stupid thing that he really wants you to? Looking with him at the apartment he is thinking of renting?).
<br>Some people say, "Never ever lend money to a friend."  It's true; if you expect the money to be paid back, it can lead to conflict. I suggest lending money to a friend in need, but never expect or demand it be paid back. The purpose of money is to make people's lives better, and a little "loan" to a person in need can do wonders. 
<br>Go beyond the minimum, and you will bond. I don't just mean him to you; also you to him. Such friendships are wonderful and invaluable. They dramatically enhance your life, and are worth investing in.

What is the most difficult thing you have ever convinced someone of?
<html><body>
<br>A friend of ours, Shana S., wanted to be pre-med but she was frightened to death of calculus. I spent some time with her, explaining the concepts, working with her on problems, trying to make the concepts intuitively obvious. I knew she was smart; I suspected she just had a childhood fear of math that lasted into college.
<br>After  a few weeks, suddenly she really got into it. She decided she loved it. She found it intuitive. She no longer solicited my help. Then, at the end of the semester, she proudly showed me her final grade, A+.
<br>The most wonderful thing about teaching is that your student can learn far more than you teach. You are not filling a bucket; you are trying to light a fire.
<br>She was accepted into medical school, and now has her M.D.

What is the most frightening moment you have ever experienced?
<html><body>
<br>My most frightening experience was an attempted murder that took place on my very own bed at 5 am in the morning--a violent and vicious attack, with intense screams and caterwauling. Chinook, our pet cat, had been sleeping on our feet and was attacked without warning by Fluffy, a mean cat who lived across the street but who had snuck into our house. 
<br>The most frightening experience is not always the most dangerous. 
<br>[note added, due to questions: When we entered the fray on Chinook's side, Fluffy quickly evaluated the odds and withdrew. Chinook seemed less traumatized than we were; she appeared to take it in stride.]

What is it that nobody tells you about having children?
<html><body>
<br>People tell you but you don't believe it: how much you will love your children. Nobody can convince you that a new person, a complete stranger, one who didn't even exist just a year earlier, will trigger this sort of love. You may have searched years for a person you could marry, but now one is just given to you (well, that's the man's point of view) out of seemingly nowhere.
<br>I fell in love with my first daughter as I was holding her at the hospital. My wife had some minor complications, and the nurse handed the baby to me.  I looked down at her. Suddenly she became slightly agitated. She was moving her head. Then it hit, almost without warning: a sneeze! It seemed to me that it almost knocked off her head, and clearly she was equally distressed. Then we both sensed another one coming on. She tensed up; so did I. What could I do? She lowered her head closer to her chest and held it tightly; I'd swear she clenched her fists. The sneeze came, and in her new defensive position, it was nothing. She had learned how to sneeze, and I had watched her learn!
<br>Some fathers say watching their child be born was one of the greatest experiences of their lives. For me, it was watching my little girl learn how to sneeze.
<br>The nurse asked me to hand the baby back to her. I was a little bit uneasy at doing this. I understood this child better than she did. She was my baby. How did I know the nurse would be sufficiently gentle? This was my love, not hers. But then the nurse put the baby down on my wife and my wife held the baby and I could see the same love between the two of them.
<br>Children bond to parents, but the bonding of parents to a child is just as strong, maybe stronger. 
<br>I know parents who deny that love, and I feel deeply sorry for them. If you let your instincts loose, you discover that you have doubled your life, or (if you were deeply in love with your spouse) then at least increased it from 2 to 3 ... or more, for subsequent children. Children are the greatest joy in life (even better than physics!), and all you really have to do is let loose and go for it.

What is the most ridiculous thing that you have ever convinced someone to believe?
<html><body>
<br>I taught my secretary how to pass herself off as a physicist at a party.  I was inspired by Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle of My Fair Lady. It wasn't very hard. She memorized a bit of doggerel about relativity and quantum physics. She said her work was in the study of subnuclear particles, in particular the behavior of the cascade hyperon. She worked at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, so she knew of some of the big machines there, the Bevatron and the Cyclotron. She ordered equipment for us, so it wasn't hard for her to claim she was designing the apparatus. We taught her to answer unknown questions by saying "That's just a consequence of Maxwell's equations" or "That's what you get when you work out Schrödinger's equation."
<br>She told me later that the main value of this training was in occasional use to repel guys who were hitting on her.  Citing equations is a great way to end a conversation.

Finite Element Analysis: If you could keep an egg straight up, how many kilograms can it hold before it's crushed?
<html><body>
<br>Do the experiment!  Have fun doing it!
<br>In our education, we spend so much time on theory that we lose track of reality. That's why some majors require a lab course. In ancient Greece, Antaeus was a wrestler who could crush all opponents; Hercules defeated him because he knew that Antaeus' strength derived by contact with the ground. He lifted him off the ground and easily crushed him.
<br>I imagine this legend was meant as a lesson for the gentleman farmer who thinks of himself as a farmer but hasn't dirtied his hands in years. You must touch the ground to know reality!   The lesson today is a good one for physicists too.  Forget about experiment, forget about reality, and you drift away from physics into mathematics and, even worse, fantasy.
<br>Why ask the question on Quora when you can find out yourself?
<br>OK - to answer the question: I just went into the kitchen and tried it. I got 8.0 kg, plus an egg for lunch.

Life: What is the single greatest thing that your parents have ever taught/given you?
<html><body>
<br>Generosity.
<br>My parents were not wealthy. Neither graduated from high school. My dad worked nights at the check-clearing division of a bank; my mom was a housewife and part-time assistant to a dentist who had a nearby office; her dad was a coal miner in Pennsylvania. Our family lived week-to-week, although I never realized that when I was a child. I later learned that spaghetti on Friday was not only due to the non-meat dictum of Catholicism at the time, but also because the paycheck from last Friday was almost used up and there was no money for meat.
<br>Yet my mom told us we could go to any college we got into.  I went to Columbia, my older sister went to Harpur, and my younger sister went to Stoneybrook. Scholarships helped, and we were expected to have summer jobs, but my parents never told us how deeply in debt they had gone because of college loans.
<br>There were also many little acts of generosity, small amounts given when I was in need. There was no wasted money; I was not indulged. As a child, for Christmas, I could ask for a microscope or telescope and they accommodated; this was before the day when these devices had become as cheap as they are today. They generously supported my early interest in science.
<br>When I got a part-time job in college, I was allowed to spend all that I earned. I saved to take a half-summer trip around the country with my friends, and when cash ran low, my mom without asking sent me some cash to help our trip. 
<br>Later, when my parents grew old, we helped them to move out of the Bronx, where the neighborhood had become dangerous for them. Later, we arranged for them to move in with us in Berkeley.  It was wonderful to have our children get to know my parents. I have many delightful stories about that, some of which I have already shared on Quora. As they grew older, we had to take care of their finances. It was only then that we saw the records of their attempts to save money, and the loans they had taken out to enable us to get to college; loans that took two decades to pay off, and which had been kept hidden from us.
<br>My parents were incredibly generous, but never let on, so we never felt in debt to them. That is what I now recognize as the truest and most meaningful generosity. I give my parents and their unspoken generosity much of the credit for anything good I have achieved or will achieve in my life.

What is the most unfair advantage a person can have?
<html><body>
<br>Motivation. 
<br>I learned this when I suffered from depression. I've also had some close relatives that have so suffered, and innumerable students. I think of that condition as the disappearance of motivation.  Sadly, it is often interpreted by others as laziness.  It isn't; it is an illness that can be treated and cured.
<br>Now that I am recovered, I cherish the fact that I want to accomplish things; I want to produce, to help, to do things.  Why? I don't know. I do know that I get far more satistifaction from accomplishing something new and important than I do -- even from eating chocolate!  
<br>I no longer take motivation for granted.

What have you tried for 30 days that changed everything?
<html><body>
<br>After having watched this Ted Talk on the subject, what have you tried? ted.comTry something new for 30 days
<br>I gave up lunch.
<br>I didn't want to miss the social aspects of lunch, so I went along, bought a diet coke, and sipped as I watched people eat. I watched them gobble down bacon cheeseburgers and fries. It was fascinating. After a few weeks, I discovered the joy of smells even when lacking the consummation of swallow. (Please notice the pun.)
<br>I could see the pleasure they got from the first bite. Delicious! Then the lunch continued, usually with a good conversation, sometimes about new physics, sometimes about world events, sometimes about local politics, and they took bites without apparently noticing. Then the last bite: once again they became alert to food. This was the end. And they enjoyed that last bite.
<br>I concluded that they enjoyed only two bites. And actually, two bites of those luscious cheeseburgers supplied enough calories for most of a day. (But I didn't need them. I had a good breakfast and a great dinner.)
<br>I played a little game at lunch whenever I went with new people. If they were thin, and ordered cheeseburgers and fries (and at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory cafeteria, they were so good that that's what was recommended), then I predicted they would leave fries on the plate. If the luncher was noticeably heavy, then I predicted a finish of every last fry. My predictions were right almost every time.
<br>(It had never occurred to me that I didn't have to finish a lunch! I guess I was brought up thinking that I had to clean my plate to keep some poor child in India from dying. At least, that's what I recall my mom telling me.)
<br>After 3 pm, I began to feel hungry. That's when I used to go get a snack. No more. I wanted to keep my weight down, so I just endured the hunger. Now and then I gave in and bought a chocolate chip cookie. But I didn't enjoy it. I realized it had deprived me of my feeling of well-being. Was I enjoying being hungry in the afternoon? Yes! The kind of mild hunger I was feeling was not true hunger; it was not the kind of hunger felt by the homeless or the poor people in the developing world. It was a sensation that I had previously interpreted as "time to eat." I gave it a new interpretation. Now when I felt it I said to myself, "My diet is working!"
<br>The best part was dinner. I realized that for decades I had not been hungry when I came to the dinner table. I had nibbled on "appetizers" or had a late afternoon snack. The great meal of the day, the one that had the most delicious food, was eaten but only mildly enjoyed. But now, with hunger, it was a special event! I worked to slow myself down, to enjoy every bite (not just the first and the last). Dinner became one of the highlights of the day.
<br>(Incidentally, one of the "tricks of life" that my wife and I came up with 49 years ago was that we would always have a sit-down dinner together, with the table set and the food served before we start. I cook dinner 4 nights each week; she cooks 3, and bakes bread on her Breville bread machine for our breakfasts.)
<br>As I lost weight, I rediscovered the joy of walking. I live about a mile from campus, and the walk to campus became a short walk. I would make it just to get a cappuccino. (On these occasions I did allow myself a teaspoon of sugar, but no cookie to go with the coffee.) It was interesting how walking distances shortened when I weighed less. I now take a 5 mile hike (with an 800 foot rise) up in the Berkeley Hills twice every week.
<br>The 30 day no-lunch project was successful, and I continued in my new habit. When I started, I weighed about 205 lb. Over two years I gradually reduced to 185. That was about 20 years ago and I am still at 185. The trick about a "diet" is to recognize that it is not temporary. It is a change in life style. But the bigger trick is to recognize that the pleasure you gain is far greater than the pleasure you lose.

Can a dragon possibly exist?
<html><body>
<br>Ancient humans found dragon bones, giant reptile skeletons, lying out in the open, but they were unlike the bones of any lizard or snake or amphibians that they knew. Their pelvic bones were very different; they closely resembled those of birds. The obvious  conclusion: that meant these giant reptiles could fly!  Moreover, their bones were made of stone! Impervious to fire! Putting two and two together, they knew that these animals must be the source of the fire that came down from the sky, setting forests on fire. They were fire-breathing. It all made sense.  And the legends of dragons were born from this early attempt at scientific logic.
<br>Indeed, a fundamental characteristic of dinosaurs is the bird-like structure of their pelvic bones. That's why modern scientists believe that the birds are the only living descendants of the dinosaurs. Moreover, the earliest fossils were found out in the open. When Darwin came to South America, he didn't have to dig to find the fossilized bones of the giant sloth. Erosion exposed such bones, and in areas low on people, those bones stayed around until collected by prehistoric humans.  And prehistoric  humans knew the bone structure of animals far better than does the average modern man, with the exception of the modern butcher; that's because ancient people were their own butchers.
<br>No wonder the legends of dragons are so widespread, as widespread as the fossils of dinosaurs. How else could ancient humans have interpreted these finds?
<br>But pelvic bones are insufficient to enable flight. The link to lightning was false. The interpretation of the stone bones was wrong; it indicated that they were ancient, fossilized, not contemporary. So, alas, no, dragons don't exist.
<br>Moreover, we now know that large animals cannot have sufficient strength in their wings to fly, at least if they are made of muscle as we know it. The biggest you can get is a condor, and that bird arguably glides; it can't take off from level ground. This is a consequence of the physics calculation of how much air you have to push downwards to support weight; as you get bigger, the weight increases as the cube of the dimension, but the strength of the muscles (depends on the cross-section) increases only as the square. So when you get to something larger than a meter, the muscle strength of animals is not sufficient. A similar inverse argument accounts for the fact that ants and other insects seem incredibly strong. But make an ant big, and it could not carry its own weight.
<br>These arguments don't mean that you can't name something a dragon, be it a Komodo Dragon, a Nile Crocodile, or a dragon fly. But the dragons of legend don't exist and never did.

What is the best marriage advice you would give?
<html><body>
<br>When you have been married for 3 years (or 7 years or 49 years) pretend that you have just met her (I'll give the male perspective; that's the only one I understand) and are courting her again.
<br>Don't take her for granted, ever.  Seduce. Entertain. Be nice. Do all those things you did when you were trying to win her over. Do things just to make her happy, even if you don't get credit. Ignore her flaws. Do nice things without expecting reward, and be delighted when you are rewarded.
<br>Do this, and you'll be amazed how much pleasure you get out of it.
<br>I've been working at it for 49 years. We'll celebrate our 50th anniversary this September.

What would happen if a gravitational wave hit me?
<html><body>
<br>A gravity wave did hit you last September 14 at a little bit after 9:50 UT.   The same one that was detected by LIGO hit the entire Earth (and much more) including you.
<br>When it hit you, you stretched slightly in a direction perpendicular to the direction the wave came from, and compressed slightly in the third direction.  The total amount of stretching and compression was much less than the size of a nucleus of the atom, so you didn't notice.  In fact, it was so tiny that even if your body were kilometers in size, the stretching and compression would have been much less than that of a nucleus.
<br>When it hit, you oscillated several times, mimicking the signal from LIGO, shown in the figure below, adapted from the professional publication that reported the discovery.

What are some actual reasons why people think Donald Trump would be a bad president, not including his appearance/wealth?
<html><body>
<br>Like honestly, I have looked all over the internet and the only reasons people can say for why he shouldn't be president is his appearance(hair), bragging of his wealth(he worked hard people!), and that he would put our country in danger by pissing off other countries' leaders.
<br>I was particularly worried over his answer to the question, "How do you know that the President of Mexico is purposefully sending criminals to cross into the United States." His answer was that he had talked to a border guard, and that's what the border guard told him.
<br>What worries me about this answer is Trump’s gullibility, his complete naivety in knowing how to establish truth. It never occurred to him that the border guard was giving an opinion and not a fact. It didn't occur to him that a border guard might not be an expert on the hidden actions of the Mexican president. Yet the ability to evaluate truths is essential to good decisions.
<br>When asked about the triad, he had no idea what the questioner was talking about. I suspect that every other candidate actually did. The triad refers to an aspect of our nuclear defense that involves three different modes for delivering nuclear weapons: airplanes, land-based missiles, and submarine based missiles. You can not read about the history of nuclear weapons without coming across this central doctrine; its purpose was to assure that a Russian first-strike could not be simple and aimed at only one vulnerability. I don't expect every citizen to know this, but it is something that anyone who has spent any time thinking or reading about US defense policy knows. He did his best to answer without knowing what the question was, instead of asking. He was hiding his ignorance, of course; that's what politicians do. But I was appalled that someone running for president was so uneducated about US defense setup.
<br>Of course, when he has to make a decision, he could ask an advisor. But as with the border patrol, I don't think he is prepared to evaluate the answer of an advisor, or even pick the right advisor.
<br>I don't care that much what the economic policy of the US President is, since whatever it is, it has to be negotiated with Congress. I want a President who will act swiftly and properly in an emergency. To do that, he has to have studied national issues, ideally for his entire life, not just once he is elected. He has to know how to depend on and evaluate the advice and suggestions of others. I have the sense that in his career, Trump focused on the business world so narrowly that he didn't come to know the wider world of defense, not at all. Moreover, he depended deeply on his own instincts, and in the real estate world, that was good enough for him to become rich. He has good instincts for property. The job of US President is much tougher, and I don't want someone who depends on his intuition when it is poorly informed by facts.
<br>Normally, I don't share my politics publicly. Most of the candidates running for the job of US President would do OK, even the ones I will not vote for. I have no faith that Donald Trump would do OK.

What (trivial) knowledge might save your life one day?
<html><body>
<br>People frequently kill other people and themselves, when they swerve their autos on a highway to avoid hitting a small animal.
<br>This is a painful fact to learn. I learned it from my daughter, who learned it from an emergency room doctor. It is never safe to suddenly change lanes, and on a highway, even if you take that half instant to think you are checking, it can be disastrous. 
<br>This is not a happy message. It is a terrible thing to kill a dog who has wandered out on the freeway.  I was in the passenger seat next to my daughter when she did that.  She told me afterwards about what the emergency room doctor had previously told her; I believe it was right after he had treated a victim. Killing a dog was traumatic for her and for me, but we are both still alive.

What are some amazing facts about Earth, that most people don't know?
<html><body>
<br>The heat from volcanoes comes from radioactivity in the crust of the Earth.  Geysers come from water coming in contact with rock that was heated by radioactivity.
<br>In fact, if you go down in a mine, the deeper you go, the warmer it gets. Go about a mile down, and the temperature is about 100 °C, 212 °F.  Miners who work in deep ones are very familiar with this high temperature. You may think that caves are cold, but if you go deep, it gets very hot. Virtually all of that warmth comes from radioactivity in the rock which heats the rock.
<br>There is a small amount of heat coming from the core of the Earth, and we don't think that comes from radioactivity. It probably comes from the solidification of liquid in the core. But most of the heat coming towards the surface, the heat that makes it pretty hot when you go down, the heat that creates lava and geysers, comes from natural radioactive potassium, uranium and thorium in the rock.   
</body></html>
How does one explain gravitational waves for layman like me?
<html><body>
<br>Gravitational waves are what happens when you shake space itself. Just like when you shake a rope, the shake moves down the rope, when you shake space, the shake travels. When it passes by two mirrors, the distance between them changes (because space is being shook), and that's what LIGO detects -- a change in the distance between two mirrors.  According to theory, gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. This has not yet been verified, but it probably will be verified by future measurements with LIGO.
<br>LIGO detects gravitational waves by measuring light that is bouncing back and forth between those two mirrors. If the distance changes, it affects the light, and that's what is observed.
<br>Incidentally, the reason they are called "gravitational waves" and not "gravity waves" is that "gravity waves" refers to ordinary water waves and other phenomena that depend on gravity. If there were no gravity, and you splashed water, the splash would just stay; it wouldn't move away from the splash point. So to differentiate gravitational waves, they are called gravitational, not gravity. But, among physicists, in ordinary conversation, they are frequently just called gravity waves.

What are some mind-blowing facts about food?
<html><body>
<br>Organic vegetables are much higher in carcinogens than are vegetables grown sprayed with pesticides. This fact was discovered by Bruce Ames who was, at that time, the chair of biochemistry at UC Berkeley.
<br>The discovery was easily understood. To grow foods without pesticides, you have to pick those subspecies that are "naturally resistant" to insects and fungus. That invariably means that they have higher levels of "natural" poisons in their skin and in their flesh. So those farmers who picked the plants that didn't need pesticides were picking plants that (to use Ames' terminology) were surviving by engaging in chemical warfare.
<br>Non-organic foods are grown using pesticides that are extensively tested by the FDA to be non-cancer inducing (or at least minimally so). Moreover, they are on the outside of the skin, not in the meat itself, and so can be washed off easily.
<br>I eat many organic foods because they often taste better; they are frequently grown by farmers who care more about taste than appearance.  I don't delude myself into thinking that they are healthier.
<br>Bruce Ames, by the way, is the inventor of the "Ames test" — the most widely used method to determine if materials are mutagenic.
<br>His professional publication describing what I just said is Science, Volume 236, Issue 4799 (Apr. 17, 1987), 271-280.  Nobody disputes his scientific findings, but those who favor organic food often ignore them. They fool themselves into thinking that natural poisons are somehow better than mild human-manufactured pesticides.

What's the weirdest question you've been asked when crossing an international border?
<html><body>
<br>"You Merken?"
<br>I answered, "Yes" and he let me pass, without showing any ID. 
<br>The year was 1963, and the border between US and Mexico didn't require ID; to speed things up, they just asked the question, and if you answered in English (rather than in Spanish) and sounded and looked American, they let you through with no further examination.
<br>I had managed to figure out what he meant. In American slur, he was asking, "Are you an American?"  
<br>I compare that test to the famous requirement used by the ancient Hebrews to distinguish Ephraimites from Gileadites. They had them pronounce "shibboleth". The Gileadites  could not pronounce "sh". (See the Book of Judges, chapter 12.) Maybe only a native American could understand what "You Merken?" meant.

What's the worst thing a boss has ever asked you to do for your job?
<html><body>
<br>Look busy.
<br>It was summer, I was in high school, and I had a summer job as a busboy. My job, clean the tables, sweep the floors, take out the trash. If I finished, just pretend to be doing the same thing.  Customers don't like seeing employees idle.
<br>I would have liked to chat with the other employees or to talk to the customers. No. That looks unprofessional. Just look busy. 
<br>It reminded me of the Disney film Cinderella, in which Cinderella has finished her tasks, and her stepmother says, "Then do it again."
<br>It helped me understand why solitary confinement is the worst punishment for prisoners. Boredom is worse than pain.
<br>Of course, for many years (decades) now I have not had a boss. That's a fortunate position for a tenured professor; even our nominal bosses know they can't really tell us what to do.
<br>I think I am pretty lucky that this trivial problem is the worst a boss had done to me, compared to the other answers I read for this question.

What are some really interesting facts about bridges?
<html><body>
<br>The weight of an enormous crowd completely flattened the arch of the roadway on the Golden Gate Bridge, on May 24, 1987. The weight was nearly 50% above the original design load of the bridge.
<br>It was the 50th anniversary of the bridge, and in the morning it was closed to traffic, open only to pedestrians. A much larger crowd than anticipated showed up. The bridge has a normal arch, rising to a peak in the center, but on that day, it flattened, the center dropping 7 feet from the weight, the cables stretched, and the towers were pulled inward. Bumper-to-bumper cars are not nearly as heavy as are shoulder-to-shoulder people.
<br>Now that you've heard the scary story, let me admit that most engineers believe the danger of collapse was small. As was pointed out to me by Ian McClatchie, in the preceding year substantial dead weight had been removed from the span, and, as a result, the actual weight of the crowd was not 50% above the design load, but 14% below. And, bridges are typically made stronger than the design load; there is a safety factor to make sure that even at the design load, a sudden gust of wind or an undetected flaw would not cause the bridge to collapse.
<br>Perhaps the bigger danger was the possibility of panic. Huge crowds with no easy escape create dangerous situations. If the crowd had noticed the flattening of the bridge (and, apparently, some did), and rushed to get off, the threat of trampling was very real. The crush of the crowds did frighten some people; according to news reports, some threw bicycles and strollers (perhaps already damaged) from the span into the ocean. See When 300,000 human sardines flattened the Golden Gate Bridge.
<br>But, two hours later, the people had left without panicking, and the bridge sprang back into its normal graceful arching shape.
<br>[I thank Ian McClatchie for providing the following numbers. He estimates that the loading on the bridge from the crowd of people that day was approximately 5813 pounds per linear foot, equal to 2.9 tons per foot, nearly 50% higher than the original design load of 2 tons per foot. But because dead weight had been removed in the previous year, the new design load was upped to 3.37 tons per foot, and the value that day of 2.9 was 14% below this value.]

What should be my reaction if my child trips and falls?
<html><body>
<br>My wife and I decided that we would let our children hurt themselves, but would not let them damage themselves.
<br>If they fall and hurt themselves, but draw no blood, then we comment on their fall, but don't make a fuss. Did you hurt yourself?  Oh, that makes me sad. How does it feel? Can you get up? Do you want help?
<br>Of course, if they broke the skin I'd take them home to put some antibiotic on it, and a pretty bandaid. I'd tell my wife, in front of my daughter, "She fell and hurt her knee.  She was very brave."
<br>I recall one time when I was at a party at Codonices Park in Berkeley, and there was a magnificent climbing tree. At least my 7-year-old daughter thought so, and she had great fun climbing it. No other children at the party (there were about 5 others) were allowed up by their parents. One of the mothers came over to me and said, "Why do you let her do that?  It's very dangerous." I replied, "There's soft grass under the tree.  If she falls, she probably won't do any more than break an arm."  The mother seemed horrified.  
<br>In fact, my daughter broke her arm only once, actually only her wrist, on a ski trip, and not in a place that you would have thought so dangerous: getting off a ski lift.
<br>A few years later we took our children to La Mer de Glace, the great glacier up in the Alps outside of Chamonix.  It was, perhaps, the most intrinsically dangerous place we ever took our family, a huge ice flow full of cracks and openings. We let them wander, but I made sure I was always close enough to grab them if they wandered too close to a crevasse.
<br>I attach a photo. I staged the photo; she is not actually leaping over the crevasse. It's not as dangerous as it looks.  In fact, I was amazed at how careful both of my children were. They would see a crevasse, and then approach cautiously, get down on their bellies, and inch up to it. They knew how to be careful. I assume that's because they had hurt themselves in the past and could recognize danger.
<br>
<br>We always felt it important to teach our children that it is OK to take calculated risks. Now the girl walking across the crevasse is an adult, and the executive director and  coFounder of our non-profit research organization Berkeley Earth.

What are some examples of bad design?
<html><body>
<br>I once had a Hewlett-Packard data logger that had all the buttons grouped according to HP's perception of function. Data was accumulated (in those days) incrementally.  After several hours of data collection, you had to press a button to save it to magnetic tape. 
<br>Right next to the save button was the "erase" button. It worked instantly.

What are some stories about your dad you would want your kids to know about?
<html><body>
<br>My dad didn't mind getting lost. That drove my mom nuts.
<br>They would go out for a drive, and she would be frantically trying to follow the map (this was in pre-GPS days) but to no avail. He didn't care. I recall him saying, "Don't worry, we'll find our way back."
<br>I think his attitude was very important in my own development. For some reason, I adopted his approach, and not that of my mom. (I adopted my mom's approach on many other things, however.) If you're not afraid of getting lost, the world becomes much bigger, and I don't just mean the geographical world.

What are some things you realize as you get older?
<html><body>
<br>History is not as ancient as I used to think.
<br>I was born in 1944, during the end of WWII. When I was 10 years old, that seemed like ancient history. It was a lifetime ago. The Depression?  That was beyond ancient. 
<br>Now I am 72 years old, and remarkably, the past is coming closer. I was alive when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. I was raised in the aftermath of the Depression.  My grandparents were raising their children during WWI, when Nicholas was still tsar of Russia and Wilhelm was Kaiser of Germany. And shortly before that we had the Civil War. And just before that, the Revolutionary War. And just before that we were hanging witches in Salem. When I was young, I did not realize how much the world had changed in such a short time.
<br>When I think of events in terms of my lifetime, history seems closer. It wasn't that long ago that Europe was ruled by kings and queens, and democracy was just a dream. As you age, those bits of history will move closer for you too. If you recognize that, it will help you to understand the role that history has played in modern times. The United States declared independence in 1776. For me, that was a little over 3 lifetimes ago.

Why are pyramids found in so many ancient civilisations?
<html><body>
<br>Pyramids are the biggest structure that you can build with some assurance that they will not fall down. As a result, if you want a huge monument, the pyramid is the way to go. Cubic structures tend to splay out from the weight above. The famous "Flying Buttresses" of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris were added specifically to overcome this failing.
<br>Even so, there can be problems. The famous "Bent Pyramid of Snefru" in Egypt was begun with a rather steep rising angle of 54 degrees, but then half way up the angle reduces to 43 degrees. It is widely believed that this was altered in mid-construction when the steep sides showed evidence of instability; some people speculate that the change came when  another 54 degree  pyramid  spontaneously collapsed.
<br>Try piling up dry sand and you'll understand.

What is the best way to answer a student who says, "Why are we learning this? We are never going to use geometry or Shakespeare in the real world"?
<html><body>
<br>I was watching an interview with a well-known actress a few years ago. She was opposing  nuclear power, and made some statements about the aftermath of 3-Mile Island. After she went on for a while, the interviewer pointed out that she got many of her facts wrong. She was indignant.  "This is not about facts," she said. "It's about feelings!"
<br>Many, maybe most people have a similar approach to life. There is a marvelous description of this attitude in the wonderful book, Uncommon Sense by Alan Cromer. Most of the world makes decisions based on feelings, not taking into account thoughtful analysis. Yet nothing conflicts with good decision making as much as giving in to this instinct.
<br>In my mind, Shakespeare and Geometry teach the most essential lessons needed for a productive and successful life. Properly taught, they teach you to think, to take in the evidence, to analyze, and to deduce. My favorite Shakespeare course was taught by Prof. Hugh Richmond at Berkeley; I went to all the lectures (as an auditor) and did the readings while I was a graduate student earning my Ph.D. in physics at Berkeley, but this course was very important to me. Whenever I see Prof. Richmond, I thank him yet again for this course. No course gave me more insight into human behavior. Or about writing and persuasion -- Shakespeare's methods for convincing us of his insights.
<br>Think of Antony's great speech, "Friends, Romans, Countrymen ..." and how he brings a hostile crowd to his own point of view. In what other course would you learn how to do that? Is that a skill that will prove useful in your future life?  Let me ask that differently.  Is there any more important skill?
<br>And it is not just the way that Antony does it. It is the very fact that he does it. Recognize that, and you become aware of an aspect of life that you don't get in a physics or engineering course.
<br>About writing.... Shakespeare sets the standard, not in flowery language, but in vivid language, language that makes you understand what it is that Shakespeare wanted you to understand.  That's why you need to read (or better yet -- watch) the originals, not the short study guides designed to give you the plot and help you with a pop quiz.
<br>Think of what we learn about life and love from Much Ado About Nothing, about how two people who hate each other can change and feel deep and true love towards each other. I can go on and on, and if you had a good Shakespeare course, so can you. Many of the great books are comparably good; I particularly love the Russian novels, especially War and Peace. But I sometimes just sink into Moby Dick and read it again.
<br>Geometry is the class that teaches us about logical thinking, about what it means to draw a conclusion, about the meaning of truth and how we can test it to see if it is correct or false. Most reality cannot be reduced to simple theorems in the way we do for geometry, but a study of that subject shows us that at least some truths really do exist; some speculation is definitely false, and with careful thought and analysis, you can (at least sometimes) tell the difference.
<br>Of course, there is a limited amount you can learn from these courses. They are really meant to trigger a lifelong learning, of logic, of literature, of books and plays, of fact-based knowledge and knowledge of people and persuasion, a lifelong learning that informs and educates. Stick with it for a few decades and you will understand and be able to control and influence much of the world around you.
<br>If the actress I was referring to had studied geometry, maybe she wouldn't have been so cavalier about whether facts matter; if she had studied Shakespeare, maybe she wouldn't have been so cavalier about total trust in the guidance of feelings.
<br>If you are older, and feel that you don't understand the world; if you feel powerless and cheated out of life, it just may be because you didn't study Shakespeare or Geometry when you were younger, or because you just got through them, instead of getting into them.

I just discovered a major continuity error in a terrific movie nominated for an Oscar that would likely keep it from winning. Should I keep quiet?
<html><body>
<br>If you look on IMDb - Movies, TV and Celebrities for your movie, and check "goofs", you'll often find a list of continuity and other minor errors.
<br>For The Revenant, it lists 5 continuity errors, one error with crew or equipment visible, and a few others.
<br>For Spotlight it lists 3 errors in continuity, 5 anachronisms, and a bunch more.
<br>For The Big Short it currently lists only 1 continuity error, 8 anachronisms, and 3 factual errors.
<br>Similarly for the other films.  Nobody can produce an absolutely flawless movie. As I was told by a rug maker in Marrakech, only God is perfect.

Has Richard Muller ever done drugs?
<html><body>
<br>The year was 1978, and I was being interviewed as part of an investigation for renewing my Top Secret security clearance. Ronald Reagan was now president, and the rules had been changed. Previously I had been asked if I used any "addictive" drugs, and I had truthfully answered "no". But now they asked specifically if I used or had ever used marijuana.  "Yes," I replied.  When? "About two weeks ago."  How often? "Typically, about once per month." With whom? "With my wife. I never smoke it except privately with my wife."
<br>The agent seemed confused and upset. He left the room for a while. I figured my security clearance would be terminated.  Fifteen minutes later he came back. "If we were to renew your clearance, would you be willing to refrain from all future use of marijuana and other illegal drugs?"
<br>I replied without hesitation, "Yes."
<br>I was surprised I answered so quickly. I guess Marijuana wasn't really that important to me or my wife, but working on urgent and important issues of US National Security was.  In addition, I thought of my new baby.  I thought it might be good to have her grow up in an environment in which marijuana was not being used. Not that it was a big deal. We had wine for dinner every night; mild drugs are not so horrid. But this one had become illegal, and so it might be best.
<br>It was not a big deal.

Journal: What is the funniest research paper you have ever read?
<html><body>
<br>Warning: this humor is exceedingly dry.
<br>It was the paper "The Origin of the Chemical Elements" by R. Alpher, H. Bethe, and G. Gamow, published 1948, in The Physical Review, Vol. 73, page 803. The humor is well hidden.  Bethe did not see the paper until, to his surprise, it appeared in print. He had not written a word of it, nor done any of the work; it was all new to him.
<br>His name had been added as a joke by George Gamow.  Gamow couldn't resist the unique opportunity to have a paper that was a pun on the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha, beta, and gamma. 
<br>Even today, this paper is referred to as the
αβγ

paper, but usually with a smile.

Islam: Why does the Muslim world lag behind in science?
<html><body>
<br>41 Muslim majority countries (20% of world population) generate less than 5% of its science. This is the proportion of citations of articles published in internationally circulating science journals. Britain has less than 1% of the global population and produces 16% of science. Why is this?
<br>I am far from an expert in history, but I do know something about science, and my friend Walter Alvarez once told me his theory to answer this question.
<br>For several hundred years, countries practicing Islam were the most technologically advanced in the world.  They honored science, and would happily welcome Jews and Christians into their midst, and allow them to practice their own religions. (In fact, they respected Jews and Christians particularly since they both were built on the Bible, a sacred book in Islam.) Some of these infidels were warmly accepted as top government advisors (as long as they did not try to proselytize).
<br>But then in many regions, Islam shifted, rather rapidly, to a more fundamentalist approach. In Walter's terminology, fundamentalism means that when you need an answer to a question, rather than use reason, you go to the book. When you believe that there is an ultimate written authority that outweighs all logic, then you are putting up a barrier to the further development of science.
<br>Walter cites the case of Moses Maimonides, a Jewish scholar who thrived in Spain until the country moved towards fundamentalism; then he was forced into North Africa, and finally to Egypt.
<br>In western Europe, reaching full force in the 1700s, we had a period we call The Enlightenment. Arguably, the Enlightenment was a period when philosophers were attempting to find an alternative to fundamentalist Christian belief.  Although the philosophers were largely Christian, they were looking for meaningful answers, not in the Bible, but in the logical abilities of reason that they felt had been a key gift from God.
<br>Alas, in parts of the Islamic world, the recent trend has been just the opposite.

What is the craziest thing you have ever said (or done) at an interview and still got the job?
<html><body>
<br>I stayed completely silent.
<br>I was in college, and it was for a summer job that I really needed. It was at Sherman Square Studios, in NYC.  I was to replace hotel workers as they went on vacation. I would be janitor, then a switchboard operator, then a host ...  I had no qualifications. 
<br>The manager asked lots of questions. But no sooner was I part-way through my answers than he interrupted me.
<br>He explained how I was the sixth person he had interviewed, and none of them could do it. I tried to say something, but before my sentence was halfway out, he was saying something else.
<br>OK, I thought to myself. You like to hear yourself speak. I'll just be quiet. Go ahead. Talk all you want.
<br>It went on like that for about ten minutes. Then he said, "Can you start next week?"

Should I stop trying to get attractive girls?
<html><body>
<br>I'll think I'll stop trying because I can't fit in an attractive girls' requirements. I'll stick with plain-looking girls, and less attractive girls. I'm not being hypocritical, just gonna stop trying. I'm too shy, awkward, weird, and gerky (geeky?).
<br>No! Seek attractiveness!!
<br>I have a photo of my 5th grade class. All the boys in the class agreed, Tina was the most attractive. I show this photo to friends and ask them to guess which is Tina, the universally acclaimed (by those boys) "most attractive". Nobody ever guesses correctly. The reason is that it was Tina's body language, the way she smiled when she looked at you, the way she responded to things you said, all these things that made her "attractive." We all thought she was pretty. An objective analysis, made now by either adults or children, put her in the middle. But all the boys thought she was pretty.
<br>What you should avoid doing is seeking girls because others find them attractive. You may be surprised to learn that your evaluations are different from those of others. You may prefer a sweet innocence, whereas others prefer a flirt. Deep down your genes are trying to tell you who would be a good mate. Go with that, even if marriage and children are far from your current mind.

Do all the physics or mathematics professors score good grades throughout their academic life?
<html><body>
<br>I had trouble as an undergraduate. In physics, my average was B+. In a junior level physics course I once received a "D".  That might have ended my career, but I managed to convince Prof. Samuel Devons to let me take a make-up exam. (Thank you again, Prof. Devons!) It got turned into a B-. My senior year, I got several grades of C. Fortunately I had already been admitted to graduate school. Then, in graduate school, I managed to focus.
<br>This experience has made me very sensitive and sympathetic to the non-top students.

Why didn't Albert Einstein win a Nobel Prize for his work on Special/General Relativity?
<html><body>
<br>His work on Special and General Relativity is considered as one of the most important discoveries of this century. Einstein, on the other hand, won the Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect, which was groundbreaking too, but not as profound/significant as his work on General Relativity.
<br>Albert Einstein
<br>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, effecting a revolution in physics. For this achievement, Einstein is often regarded as the father of modern physics and the most influential physicist of the 20th century. While best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.
<br>So on what basis did they deny him the Nobel Prize? Frederick Sanger and John Bardeen have won it twice in the same field, in Physics and Chemistry respectively. Did the Nobel Committee ever discuss this? Was he at least nominated for the Nobel for this? Einstein didn't even attend the ceremony, choosing to go to Japan for some research instead, as he'd lost faith in the Nobel Committee.
<br>The Nobel Prize generally limits itself to one prize per person in any given field. Arguably, the photoelectric effect (for which Einstein was awarded the prize) was even more important than relativity, since it was a founding discovery for quantum physics. Bohr had postulated that atoms emitted light only in quantized amounts; Einstein showed that light itself was quantized. Then de Broglie postulated that electrons were also quantized ... and quantum physics was off and running.
<br>The double laureates were Marie Curie (physics 1903 and then chemistry in 1911), Linus Pauling (chemistry 1954, peace 1962).  John Bardeen won two in physics, the first for the transistor; but the feeling was that they wanted to give it to his coworkers in superconductivity, and couldn't really leave him out. Similarly for Sanger in 1980.
<br>So here is some useful advice: if you've won a Nobel Prize, and want to win a second one, work with a collaborator.

What's a cool math fact you can easily tell a layman and look super cool?
<html><body>
<br>Pi is approximately 3.14159... But now we know over 12 trillion digits (see Pi - 12.1 Trillion Digits ) and yet there is no known pattern in all these digits. The appearance of the individual digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, appear approximately equally, but not precisely (that would be a pattern).
<br>Mathematically, we've never proven that no pattern exists, yet we haven't found any.
<br>In Carl Sagan's novel Contact, the heroine Ellie does find a pattern in pi, and it proves to be central to the story. Better than anything else in the novel, it shows how advanced the advanced civilization really is. Yet the movie version completely omitted this part of the story, presumably because they considered it to be too arcane for the movie audience.
<br>And paradoxically, there are formulas for pi that do show extremely simple patterns, such as:
<br>π=4/1−4/3+4/5−4/7+4/9−4/11+4/13−4/15+4/17−....
π
<br>where the signs alternate, and the denominators are the successive odd numbers.
<br>It is also true that there is no circle in the real universe that has a ratio of its circumference to diameter given by this value of pi. The reason is that, according to general relativity, real space is slightly curved, and that changes the ratio away from the one computed.

What are the things your parents did that you will never do to your kids or future kids?
<html><body>
<br>Lie. I don't lie.
<br>My mom was a wonderful person, but she believed that it was proper to lie whenever she thought the lie would do some good. As my sisters and I grew up, we quickly learned that we could not trust her.
<br>When my older daughter asked me, "My friends say Santa is only pretend, and their mommy and daddy bring the presents. Is Santa Claus real? "
<br>I asked her if she really wanted to know. I implied that continuing to pretend might be a wiser choice. But no, she wanted to know. I told her I would tell her, but only if she promised not to tell her younger sister, at least not until explicitly asked. She agreed.
<br>When she was an adult, she mentioned to me how much she loved my honesty back then, and how proud she felt that I trusted her with not volunteering the secret to her sister.

What is the loveliest thing a child has ever said to you?
<html><body>
<br>"Would you like one, Grandpa?"
<br>OK -- it was not my child but my 3-year-old granddaughter, but I still think it counts.
<br>I had read about the marshmallow test. You give a child a marshmallow, and then say that if she (Layla, in this case) could keep from eating it for 10 minutes, you'll give her a second. So I tried that test with my granddaughter (not with marshmallows, but with chocolate, which she likes much more). 
<br>According to extensive experiments, children who "pass" the "marshmallow test" are far more successful in later life. They have learned a fundamental truth in life, that delayed gratification can lead to a far better long-term outcome.
<br>She sat and watched the chocolate. The 10-minute hourglass finally emptied, and she had succeeded. She asked for her second piece of chocolate.  I gave it to her, and she now had two in her hand. That's when she looked up at me and asked, "Would you like one, Grandpa?"
<br>Needless to say, from that moment on I would readily give my life for her.

<br>A dandelion. I like this because it is so simple, so everyday, and yet it shows so much. To me, this -- in a common flower -- represents all of nature from the atom, to a flower, to the Big Bang.
<br>The photo was taken just outside of Yosemite National Park. We had stopped for a picnic, and I saw the flowers, a particularly spectacular form of dandelion.  I crawled around on my belly taking photos. I used limited depth of field to create the ring; the full dandelion is still there, but the seeds in the front and back are defocused.

How likely is it that North Korea successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in January 2016?
<html><body>
<br>It was not a hydrogen bomb.
<br>It is useful to know that the first "hydrogen bomb" exploded by what was then called the Soviet Union, was also not a hydrogen bomb. It was a "boosted" fission bomb. In a boosted bomb, some small amount of deuterium and tritium (isotopes of hydrogen) are added to a fission bomb in order to improve its efficiency. They do fuse and produce lots of neutrons, but the energy comes from the additional fissions triggered from those neutrons. Boosted bombs are straightforward, no more difficult than non-boosted bombs, and I expect that is what the North Koreans tried.
<br>Did it work? It should have, but there is no evidence for it. The size of the explosion, yielding a 5.1 magnitude earthquake, is roughly what you would get from a 10 kiloton bomb, half of the energy release of the first US pure fission bomb exploded in New Mexico. So they are still producing duds.  The first three US fission bombs were not boosted, and they released considerably more energy than did this North Korean test.
<br>Nonetheless, I suspect that the engineers and physicists responsible for this bomb told Kim Jong Un that they had successfully exploded a hydrogen bomb. It was their quickest way to be able to claim "hydrogen" -- by assembling a boosted fission bomb.
<br>Moreover, I suspect the bomb was even smaller than 10 kilotons. It is in the North Korean interest to try to exaggerate the size of the blast. If I were given the job of doing that, I would do it by increasing the coupling between the explosion and the rock. (If you are trying to hide a bomb, you decrease that coupling.) The goal would be to transfer more energy to the rock, thereby fooling the seismic people into thinking that a bigger bomb was exploded. Increasing that coupling is technically far far easier than making a bigger bomb, so I assume that's what they did. That means that their "hydrogen bomb" might have been only a few kilotons, maybe 1/10 the size of the first WWII US weapons.
<br>The whole goal of a hydrogen bomb is to make a bigger explosion. The hydrogen bomb consists of two parts: an ordinary fission bomb, whose purpose is to provide the energy needed to ignite the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen. That's called the primary. Then there is a "secondary", typically consisting of lithium deuteride. This contains the deuterium that will release the fusion energy. If it were a hydrogen bomb, why did it produce no  more energy than we would have seen from the primary alone?
<br>There is no sense in making a hydrogen bomb that releases less total energy than did any of the first three bombs exploded by the US.
<br>The only danger is that the public will misunderstand, and think that North Korea has a weapon far more dangerous than it really is.  Some politicians will also misunderstand, and are likely to push for policies that don't necessarily make sense. Some politicians may actually understand, and still play on the public's exaggerated fears.

What are some mind-blowing facts related to technology?
<html><body>
<br>Eg :
Shatter (digital comic) - the world's first comics series entirely drawn on a computer.
<br>Malbolge- The most difficult language ever? Its first program had to be written by a computer.
<br>Juicychumann Marathon - shows a kid does the internet wrong.
<br>Your color TV uses one of the greatest optical illusions of all. It makes red, green, and blue dots appear to be white.
<br>Look up really close at TV or computer screen that is displaying the color white and all you’ll see are red, green, and blue dots, no white ones. (You may need a magnifying glass to see the tiny individual dots.) But if you sit back, they blur together and make white.
<br>[In a comment, Tim Volkov made an excellent suggestion: No magnifying glass needed - just a drop of water on the screen! That acts an an excellent high power magnifying glass.]
<br>Your eye has three color sensors: one each for red, green, and blue (RGB). True white light from the sun contains all the colors of the rainbow, not just RGB. True white makes all three RGB sensors respond.
<br>Here’s the trick: when the screen wants to deceive your eye into thinking the color is white, it lights up all three colors. That excites all three RGB sensors in your eye, in exactly the same way they would be excited by true white sunlight. Since that is all your brain knows – that all three have detected light – it interprets it as white light. Your brain is fooled.
<br>Some people are reputed to have four sensors, not three, so they would not be fooled by false TV white. What would it look like to them? We don’t have the words to describe the colors they see, because so few of us have that ability. They probably would call us “colorblind” for getting TV White confused with True White.
<br>[Disclosure: this is an excerpt from my book, "The Instant Physicist". The image is also from that book, drawn by Joey Manfre.]
