Remember that no site or community, is ever going to be perfect. It is a process of continuous cleaning and maintenance. If you dont like answers on a particular topic or from a particular user/blog, mute them. If someone you follow upvotes sub-standard content, unfollow them. Clean up the list of people, topics, blogs, and questions you are following.
