<html><body><br>If less than 10 percent of the black money is in cash can you give solutions to find the remaining 90 percent in other forms ? Will the property rates decrease in the long run ? What solutions can be given to those whose marraiges have been affected ? Have you personally affected by the scrapping ?<br>Lets address this one by one.<br>A. How is this a viable step to curb black money?<br>#1: Till end of the year, people will exchange or deposit existing 500 and 1000 notes at banks and post office. However, you need to show a valid government ID proof and the banks and post offices will have to maintain proper transaction records for the same.<br>For smaller amounts, there should be no issue. But if someone comes and deposits 1L in cash, it might be highlighted and escalated to the government. Modi government might have advised banks and post offices to escalate all transactions above a certain threshold.<br>All of these folks will have their background checks done and can expect a tax audit next year if their tax returns, income details etc do not justify the amount they have in black.<br>#2: Political parties can no longer disburse cash to poor people in exchange for votes.<br>#3: People in the real estate market will be hurt the most.<br>I recently saw a hoarding advertising the price of a new flat for possession at Rs 1.2 Cr. However, the hoarding said, Rs 1.1 Cr if you pay cash.<br>The maths is simple. In the first arrangement, you pay 1.2 Cr, of which some 30L goes to government as tax, and 90L goes to the builder. In the second, you pay 1.1 Cr (saving yourself a sweet 10L) and all of it goes to the builder (who nets 20L more). All of it at the loss of the government.<br>Brokers too can no longer ask people to pay in cash. I, as recently as Feb, had to pay 35,000 as the brokerage. All in cash, as the broker would simply not accept an online transfer.<br>#4: All currency hoarded with terrorists and corrupt folks is now simply useless. A terrorist walked into the bank branch with a briefcase full of cash and a fake ID just doesnt sound funny.<br>#5: All counterfeit currency production comes to a grinding halt. Counterfeiting Rs 100 and below currency notes does not make sense as it is economically unprofitable. So almost all fake currency is in the form of 500 and 1000 notes and no one is going to accept them now, so they are cut off from the money market.<br>Going forward, it would be harder to counterfeit the new 500 and 2000 currency notes as they come with a whole set of new security features.<br>#6: Forces people to resort to the banking system.<br>Majority of the Indian populace isnt corrupt. They dont hoard money at home because they want to cheat on their taxes. They just do it because they do not trust online banking or the banking system. Now these people will be forced to let go of their unfounded fears, slowly moving the nation on the path of becoming a cashless economy.<br>The more people transact online, the easier it would be for the government to keep track of all money movement and catch hold of those who abuse the system.<br>B. Why was such an extreme step taken suddenly?<br>Firstly it wasnt sudden.<br>Yes, it did catch everyone by surprise, but in hindsight we should have seen it coming.<br>Immediately after coming to power in 2014, the PM announced the Jan Dhan Yojana, aimed at financial inclusion and integrating everyone into the banking system.<br>He then followed it up with the black money declaration scheme wherein he warned of dire consequences of missing / skipping the deadline.<br>Finally, the GST approval was a lucky happenstance. GST would make tax computation easier and will increase accountability in the system. What it means is that it will be easier to figure out who exactly is the perpetrator of a tax fraud across the consumer value chain.<br>This is the final nail in the coffin.<br>It had to be done suddenly so that the corrupt do not have time to figure a way out of it.<br>C. What will be the cost of the whole process?<br>A rough ballpark estimate: INR 5000 crore<br>Above is the cost of printing specific currency notes. Lets assume that the cost of printing the new INR 500 note remains the same as the old one (INR 2.5) and lets extrapolate for the INR 2000 note (at ~INR 4).<br>Now, the total amount of currency in circulation as of Mar 2016 was:<br>Basically, there are currently 15.7 billion Rs 500 notes, and 6.3 billion Rs 1000 notes in circulation.<br>Assuming all of these are returned. Old 500 notes are replaced by new 500 ones, and old 1000 notes by new 2000 ones (just an assumption to simplify calculations).<br>Cost of printing 15.7 billion Rs 500 notes = 15.7 billion * Rs 2.5 = Rs 39 billion<br>Cost of printing 3.1 billion Rs 2000 notes (one 2000 note printed for every two 1000 notes) = 3.1 billion * Rs 4 = Rs 12 billion<br>Total cost would be approximately Rs 50 billion, or Rs 5000 crore, or 0.4% of Indias GDP.<br>D. How would those who have huge amount of cash deposit so much cash in the bank like all the billionaires?<br>The b(m)illionaires are b(m)illionaires because they do not keep such ludicrous sums at home. Their money is mostly in banks, investment portfolios, real estate etc.<br>Anyone is free to deposit any amount, but surely someone trying to deposit Rs 25L of cash will surely be flagged in the system and have to explain the source of the money and the need to store such a huge amount as hard cash.<br>E. How will the people who never watch news realize this?<br>In less than 5 hours, most people I know are talking about it. By tomorrow, anyone with a TV or a mobile will know of it. In a few days, even the folks in the remotest villages will know about it, mostly via word of mouth. I am sure the government would have memo-ed the panchayats of rural areas to put up notices to the effect.<br>Unless you are living under a rock or in a pineapple under the sea, you are going to hear about this.</body></html>
