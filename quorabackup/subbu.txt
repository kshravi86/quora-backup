<html><body><br>Also, Is it true that Apple is now providing a separate dongle for the escape key?<br>Apple hasnt just removed the Esc key, but the entire row of Fn buttons at the top.<br>While it appears like a really stupid decision at the get go, a little thought and you realize that it is exactly the opposite.<br>They havent really done away with all these keys, as much as replaced them with something more useful, a singular OLED panel, called the Touchbar. Which is nothing but a dynamic keypanel, definitely an improvement over static keys.<br>(Images courtesy Macworld)<br>The Touchbar would be populated with commands depending on what you are doing. So, while working on photoshop, you would get photo editing commands. Listening to music, you get play/volume/shuffle controls. Text editing, hopefully edit and formatting controls.<br>For over 45 years, weve been using function keys. Or, really, for the last who-knows-how-many years, we havent been using them.<br>This is what Apples head of marketing had to say. And he has a point. There was some strong opposition when mobile companies decided to do away with the physical keyboard in favor of touchscreen.<br>But a lot of keys are indeed almost never used - examples include the tilde, the various locks (num, scroll etc). Then there are duplication in terms of dual alt/ctrl/shift keys. The least frequently used keys could be bundled into a single key that pops up the entire menu. You could program some features like the Print Screen function into the touchscreen/touchbar/touchpad by mapping it to a certain gesture. (all of the preceding is purely from a Windows perspective).<br>There are a whole lot of efficiency gains to be captured. The future is going to be more digital than physical.<br>Of course, there will be some amount of refining required from the manufacturers. And some amount of time required by consumers to adjust to the new reality. But that is always the case.</body></html>
