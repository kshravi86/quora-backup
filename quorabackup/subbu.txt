<html><body><br>Yes.<br>But we cant take the entire credit for making Quora awesome. A lot of it goes to our fellow American Quorans too.<br>Still, youre welcome.<br>Jokes aside, I understand that the OP of the questions really wanted to ask if Indians are aware that Indians (and mostly the late majority that got on-board starting early 2015) have contributed to a decline in quality of the platform. And yes, as someone who started his journey when Quora was still in the early stages of adoption, I personally believe that the content quality has seen a downward trend recently.<br>And this happens to all products. The innovators and early adopters usually join a group or community out of interest. The early majority does so because it has become a fad and they want to be a part of it. The late majority are driven by a fear of missing out. Finally come the laggards, driven mostly by peer pressure.<br>The widespread popularity of Quora in India can be attributed to a growing population with internet access (a large number of which have it for the first time). The early and late majorities are often restless souls who usually try and game the system with minimal efforts. It is up to the community to have preventative measures in place and discourage such behavior.<br>Look at what has happened to Twitter. Once the go-to-source for all news breaking and important, it has now become a cesspool of anger, bigotry, and senseless fan service. Marketers regularly abuse it by pushing their corporate agenda down everyones throat. A major chunk of the Twitterverse has been taken over by bots. And amidst all the chaos, finding and consuming quality content has become a nightmare. And a lot of it is Twitters own fault for not having sufficient safeguards in place against such mis-incentives that degrade the experience for genuine users.<br>On the other hand, Reddit has done a wonderful job in the same regard. A person has complete control over his/her feed. Communities are interest-based and can have their own set of rules (apart from some site-wide ones set by the Reddit admins). The mods work crazy hard to ensure that the quality of discussions on their respective sub-reddits doesnt spiral out of control. Reddit in turn, enables them, by allowing them custom CSS access and the ability to create bots which can do a lot of mechanical work.<br>If Quora is to survive this onslaught, it must follow in Reddits footsteps:<br>And, the power users also need to do their part in all of this.<br>Remember that no site or community, is ever going to be perfect. It is a process of continuous cleaning and maintenance. If you dont like answers on a particular topic or from a particular user/blog, mute them. If someone you follow upvotes sub-standard content, unfollow them. Clean up the list of people, topics, blogs, and questions you are following.</body></html>
